abstract = "Quality (security included) does not have to be neglected when you’re planning, building and running a high performance development team. Kim will set the stage with how and why Agile Development Teams fail, explained with a familiar anecdote taken from his new book “[Holistic Info-Sec for Web Developers](https://f0.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/)”, coupled with how you can change this. Kim will then cover a set of light weight processes, practises and tools, that when combined have proven their value in: (1) Aiding high throughput (reducing time to market) (2) Significantly increasing quality (finding and removing bugs) (3) Without descoping. All while reducing total project cost (fact). If this sounds like breaking the laws of physics, or to good to be true, then this talk is for you. Kim will finish off with the habits of top developers and how we can make them part of our lives."
