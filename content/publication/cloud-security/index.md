We break down and provide solid understanding of the shared responsibility model, that is: What are the CSPs responsibilities and what are your responsibilities as a consumer of the services that your chosen CSP offers. We provide a set of questions and possible answers to help you evaluate the most suitable CSP for your needs.<br><br>We discus the pros and cons of the Cloud vs In-house clouds, along with techniques for improving your understanding and implementation of the principle of least privilege in the Cloud."
