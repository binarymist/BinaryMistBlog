## Analytics

We are using Google Analytics (GA) as a third party tracking service. We do not use it to track you individually or collect personal information about you. GA is used to collect information about website performance, how users of this website interact (navigate around) with it. This helps us understand better what is of most interest to the users and any issues that may be causing frustration.

GA gathers certain simple, non-personally identifying information over time, such as your IP address, browser type, internet service provider, referring and exit pages, time stamp, and similar data about your use of this website.
