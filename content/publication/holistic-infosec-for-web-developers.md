# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "The book series begins (in [Fascicle 0](https://f0.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/)) by taking the reader to the 30,000â€™ view, so you can start to see the entire security landscape. Kim then attempts to explain a very simple threat modelling approach that Bruce Schneier created, called the Sensible Security Model (SSM). Kim takes the learnings from the first chapter and applies them to lower levels. Kim [details](https://f0.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap05.html#tooling-setup) how to set-up a security focussed distribution with all the tools and configuration options required for working through the book series. He then walks through the [Process and Practises](https://f0.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap06.html#process-and-practises-penetration-testing) that the attackers often execute, and we take the learnings from that and [train the defenders](https://f0.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap06.html#process-and-practises-agile-development-and-practices) on how they can bring the finding of defects from the most expensive place to the [cheapest place](https://f0.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap06.html#leanpub-auto-cheapest-place-to-deal-with-defects), within your Sprint cycles.<br><br> The rest of the book series (Fascicle [1](http://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/) and [2](http://f2.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/)) focusses on the specific areas addressed on the covers of each book. Allowing your purple team to create security focussed product backlog items and insert them into your usual [Product Backlog](https://f0.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap03.html#starting-with-the-30000-foot-view-countermeasures).<br><br> Kim also runs [workshops](http://localhost:1313/BinaryMistBlog/#workshops) based on the content of this book for development teams wishing to improve their security stature."
