# Abstract.
abstract = "Kim Carter of BinaryMist discusses dynamic application security testing (DAST) and how the OWASP purpleteam project can improve early defect detection. Host Justin Beyer spoke with Carter about how DAST can provide meaningful feedback loops to developers to improve code quality and push penetration testing to the detection of higher-level vulnerabilities. They also discussed how the OWASP purpleteam project fills a gap in the open source DAST space. While discussing purpleteam, they dove into the projectâ€™s underlying architecture, such as how it leverages the Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) project to detect the actual vulnerabilities in the application. There was also a discussion on how to integrate DAST into your software deployment pipelines."
