I deliver high quality information security talks and workshops at conferences and private events around the world.

Most of my talks and workshops are focussed around demonstrating and demystifying how easy it is to break into software and networks, followed with how you can rectify the demonstrated vulnerabilities, and make this part of your development teams process, rather than finding and fixing the defects once in production. This has the benefit of [saving significant expendature](https://f0.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap06.html#leanpub-auto-cheapest-place-to-deal-with-defects) due to finding and fixing defects late in the development lifecycle.

## Presentation style

A huge amount of effort goes into my talks and workshops, and I continue to refine my approach over time based on the feedback I receive. My talks and workshops usually contain a large amount of technical information coupled with an entertainment factor to help keep listeners and trainees engaged.
