Most of Kims talks and workshops are focussed around demonstrating and demystifying how easy it is to break into software and networks, followed with how you can rectify the demonstrated vulnerabilities, and make this part of your development teams process, rather than finding and fixing the defects once in production. This has the benefit of [saving significant expenditure](https://f0.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap06.html#leanpub-auto-cheapest-place-to-deal-with-defects) due to finding and fixing defects late in the development life-cycle.

## Presentation style

A huge amount of effort goes into Kims talks and workshops, continuing to refine his approach over time based on the feedback he receives. Kims talks and workshops usually contain a large amount of technical information coupled with an entertainment factor to help keep listeners and trainees engaged.
