Redirects to legacy blog post.

This is where A9 (Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities) of the 2013 OWASP Top 10 comes in. We are consuming far more free and open source libraries than we have ever before. Much of the code we are pulling into our projects is never intentionally used, but is still adding surface area for attack. In this post we address the risks and countermeasures.
