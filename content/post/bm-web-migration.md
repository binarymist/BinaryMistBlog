I can work on blog posts on a specific branch without pushing to github until finished. This allows one to work on other content, merge reader comments which are issued as pull requests by staticman.



Used the CSS from staticman creators [own website](https://eduardoboucas.com/blog/2017/11/14/static-api-generator.html) ([source](https://github.com/eduardoboucas/eduardoboucas.github.io)) for the notify me of new comments checkbox










##### Setup to delete branches that static man creates




##### Setup mailgun account
