This is actually a very long story. Most of those that know me well already know the details, if you want them, let's catch-up for a chat?

We have a new business, [building motorhomes for the discerning](https://www.epiclines.nz/motorhome/), and [creating accessories for New Zealand surfers](https://www.epiclines.nz/surf/). You can find the _EpicLines_ landing page at [https://www.epiclines.nz](https://www.epiclines.nz).
