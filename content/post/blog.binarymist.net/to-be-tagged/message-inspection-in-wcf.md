Redirects to legacy blog post.

Message Inspectors can be a very usefull tool in diagnosing problems between WCF services and clients. The messages that are transferred between clients/services can be intercepted and operations performed on them. Weâ€™ve used this at work in conjunction with a tool called SaopUI to capture the SOAP messages and fire them at our service. This can be usefull for load testing, concurrency testing scenarios amongst others.
