Redirects to legacy blog post.

Recently I had the opportunity for work, to carry out some research on whatâ€™s in the market in regards to bare-metal hypervisors. The following is the result of an in depth research and deployment project of the following bare-metal hyper-visors. This will enable us to trial the hypervisors out for performance, ease of setup, ease of administration, and ease of use.
