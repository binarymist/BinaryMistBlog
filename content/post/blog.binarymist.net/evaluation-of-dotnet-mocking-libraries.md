Redirects to legacy blog post.

Iâ€™ve recently undertaken another round of evaluating .NET mocking (fake/substitute/dummy/stub/ or what ever you want to call them now) libraries. Interestingly the landscape has changed quite a bit since last time I went through this exercise, which was about two years ago. The outcome of the previous investigation is at the bottom of this post.
