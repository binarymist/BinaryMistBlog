Redirects to legacy blog post.

Recently I’ve undertaken the task of reviewing some JavaScript MV* frameworks to help organise/structure the client side code within an application I’m currently working on. This is about the third time I’ve done this. Each time has been for a different type of application with completely different requirements, frameworks and libraries to consider. Unlike Angular and Ember, Backbone is a small library. Marionette adds quite a lot of extra functionality and provides some nice abstractions on top . All mentioned frameworks/libraries are free and open source.
