## Outcomes

Three meetups left for this year. What do we want to do?

### My ideas:

* Talk and workshop 3 things that Devs can do in their Sprints to improve their security, possibly a series of these?
* Session on what goes into a good build pipeline
* A walk through the new OWASP API Security Top 10 and how they compare with the OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks
* Threat modelling code, how to do it? how to get the most out of it?
* OWASP tooling and all the new projects that are happening

### Group ideas:

* Incident response talk
* Something to get more Devs in
* Software vulnerability management
* Application intrusion detection
* Panel - Ask anything

### Highest ranking talks by vote:

| Talk | Speaker(s) |
|------|------------|
| 1. Incident response talk and Application intrusion detection | Chris-Kim
| 2. Panel - Ask anything - Intention to get more Devs along | Pete-Toni
| 3. Talk and workshop 3 things that Devs can do in their Sprints to improve their security | Kim

### Spare:

1. Software vulnerability management (Kevin)
2. Session on what goes into a good build pipeline
3. Threat modelling code, how to do it? how to get the most out of it?
