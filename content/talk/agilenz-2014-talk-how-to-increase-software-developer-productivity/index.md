There are many ways to lift software developers’ productivity and, as a result, the development team’s total output. This session addresses some quick wins, as well as some that take longer to implement.

This talk was based around ideas from the following blog post

> [How to Increase Software Developer Productivity](https://binarymist.io/blog/2013/03/02/how-to-increase-software-developer-productivity/)

Also discussed in depth in Kims [book series](http://www.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com).
