Kim will then discuss and demo a set of light weight processes, practises and tools, that when combined have proven their value in:

1. Aiding high throughput (reducing time to market)
2. Significantly increasing quality (finding and removing bugs)
3. Without de-scoping

and all while reducing total project cost (fact).
If this sounds like breaking the laws of physics, or too good to be true, then this workshop is for you.

Kim will finish off with the habits of top developers and how we can make them part of our lives.
