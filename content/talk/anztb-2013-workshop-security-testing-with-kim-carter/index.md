abstract = "Join Kim Carter in a hands-on insight into security testing. Kim will discuss some of the more common security vulnerabilities being found in today’s software implementations, and will demonstrate ways of testing them. He would like to encourage anyone interested to join him in working through the “hacks” used when doing security testing. To enable participation in this session, he will use an open source security testing toolkit – Kali Linux. Anyone interested in working through the security tests with Kim is welcome to create a Kali Linux USB boot disk (instructions are on their website), and bring it with them on the night, along their own laptop/device."
