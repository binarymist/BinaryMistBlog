abstract = "This presentation draws from Kim's recent blog post \"[Journey to Self Hosting](https://binarymist.wordpress.com/2014/11/29/journey-to-self-hosting/)\" and many more resources for some high-level ideas about cloud solutions. Kim will discuss what's good and what's not good about \"the Cloud.\" Kim will provide an overview of the many security issues that entities need to think about when deciding whether to use the cloud or to build in-house infrastructure. Owning the technical expertise isn't always necessary. On the other hand, in-house solutions can provide finer grained customized solutions with potential for greater visibility and control than can cloud offerings that are more generic. Kim will also discuss his personal journey and what He has discovered along the way, including how you can make the right decisions based on othersâ€™ experiences and learn from their mistakes rather than your own."
