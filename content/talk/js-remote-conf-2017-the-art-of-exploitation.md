abstract = "In order to understand both the importance and the how to, of mitigating your attackers attempts to exploit your weaknesses, you must first understand your attackers and how they succeed. Kim will examine and demonstrate a collection of essential attacks, commonly used in the exploitation and demise of many individuals and organisations today. Kim will then address the mitigation techniques, and how the whole process of exploitation and mitigation can and should fit within each and every Scrum Sprint. All content is sourced from Kim's first and second volumes of a three part book series ([Holistic Info-Sec for Web Developers](../../publication/holistic-infosec-for-web-developers)) specifically focussed on equipping Web Developers to stay ahead of their attackers."
