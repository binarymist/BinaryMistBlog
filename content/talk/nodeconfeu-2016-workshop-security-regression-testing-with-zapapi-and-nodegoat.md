abstract = "Kim will demonstrate the [OWASP Zap API with NodeGoat](https://github.com/binarymist/NodeGoat/wiki/Security-Regression-Testing-with-Zap-API), which helps you identify vulnerabilities in your web application as you create it, rather than at the end of a project. It’s a low-cost solution useful for carrying out constant security regression testing on your product, similar to having a full-time penetration tester on your development team."
