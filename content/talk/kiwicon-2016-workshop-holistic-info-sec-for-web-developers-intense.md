The content is aimed at software engineers to teach them how to think holistically about security. The theme that runs through the training, and the book, is pulling the security focus that’s usually left until the end of the project or “go live” right into each Sprint. Baking security into the product from the [cheapest possible place](https://f0.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap06.html#leanpub-auto-cheapest-place-to-deal-with-defects). Thus saving large amounts of money due to re-work and business asset loss. Kim will be teaching attendees a very [simple threat modelling](https://f0.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap03.html#starting-with-the-30000-foot-view) process initially blue printed by one of the best security experts the world has known, Bruce Schneier, then how to apply that process to a [10,000′ view](https://f0.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap04.html#10000-foot-view-and-lower) and lower for a collection of areas:

* [Physical](http://f0.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap07.html#physical)
* [People](http://f0.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap08.html#people)
* [Cloud](http://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap05.html#cloud)
* [VPS](http://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap03.html#vps)
* [Network](http://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap04.html#network) 
* [Web Applications](http://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap06.html#web-applications)

Within each Sprint.

A hands on training, taking the [attackers perspective](https://f0.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap06.html#process-and-practises-penetration-testing) and extracting a set of development related [processes and practises](https://f0.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap06.html#process-and-practises-agile-development-and-practices) that can be augmented with your Scrum Teams existing processes and practices, creating minimum disruption and maximum cost effective security. Attendees will be able to take these learnings and apply them within their own Scrum Teams.
