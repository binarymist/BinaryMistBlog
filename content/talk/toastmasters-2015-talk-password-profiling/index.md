Kim then takes the word-lists and analysis of failed and successful login attempts to a web application and educates a collection of brute-forcing tools what an unsuccessful and successful login looks like. Then run the brute-forcing tools until the credentials have been discovered. This demonstrates that common password strategies are no longer sufficient to stop full account compromise and worse.

This is followed up with some tips on how to make this process a lot harder for attackers. Content can be found in Kims Holistic Infosec for Web Developers book.
