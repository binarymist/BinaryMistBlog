Helping you create and mentor security aware, cross functional, self-managing teams, able to create solutions that resist, and actively defend against today's security attacks, while [increasing profit and reducing costs](https://f0.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap06.html#leanpub-auto-cheapest-place-to-deal-with-defects).

<br>

Whether you're running a small or large project, we can work with you to move the information security focus from late in the development life-cycle to within the development team. Thus saving significant costs, while improving quality, productivity, and predictability of software releases.
