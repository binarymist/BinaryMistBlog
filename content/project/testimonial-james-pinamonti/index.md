> Solution Delivery Team Leader at IAG New Zealand

I have worked with Kim as a colleague and as one of his Scrum Masters on projects including application integration, ASP.Net, Windows Workflow Foundation and Windows Communications Foundation. Kim is not only knowledgeable and passionate about software design and development, but also assertive in his approach to providing the best solution in the first instance. I believe Kim would be beneficial to any project he was a member.
