> Principal Consultant - Agile | Lean at Double-O Consultants

I've had the pleasure of managing Kim and have found him to be a **highly-focused** and **very skilled** software developer. He works hard to ensure he achieves **high quality** in everything he develops and always has his employer's interests at heart.<br><br>
He wants to achieves great results and will drive himself and others around him to achieve this. Any organisation Kim is involved with will benefit immensely from his involvement.
