Not sure of how secure your business assets are?
Maybe you are thinking about establishing a security roadmap or checkpoints, but unsure of where to start, or which step to take next.

You may already be on the information security journey, but need some reassurance and clear direction along the way that you are investing in the areas that are most cost effective.


There are ways to significantly reduce the costs of security, even use security as a positive marketing avenue. Customers love it when they know you're taking the security of their data seriously.


Maybe you build software in-house and your development team(s) could do with some assistance and a sounding board to bounce their security related questions off?

Or maybe you have customers that entrust their personal data to you to manage and store in the Cloud?

# How it works

Our agreement entitles you to unlimited 24/7 access to Kim via phone, SMS, email, Slack, Skype, Signal, Telegram, or other Instant Messaging service. I return all messages no later than the next business day, although in practice response time is usually much quicker (particularly between 9am to 6pm NZT, but also nights and weekends).

Meetings are scheduled in advance, typically take place over the phone, and are sometimes supplemented with on-line meeting and/or screen sharing software (e.g. Google Hangouts, appear.in, Skype, etc).

There are several possible areas of involvement:

1. Regular meetings with the primary project contact to discuss strategy, longer-term issues, and business goals.
2. Strategic and tactical advice based on a series of ongoing meetings with team leaders. These are individualised and mutually agreed upon. In addition, I'll serve as a sounding board as they work to achieve their business and technical goals.
3. Technical review of architecture, work-flows, source code, documentation, and the like. Where appropriate, I'll provide code samples, or proof-of-concept examples. Please note that authoring shipping code, designs, or documentation is not included in this agreement.
4. Situational responsiveness to needs that arise that you deem require my assistance, which are not covered elsewhere.

Our fee covers four months, we arrange and pay for any necessary administrative expenses such as discussed communication mediums. Professional courtesy discounts are available for recurring annual arrangements.
