> Principal Recruitment Consultant, Platinum Recruitment Ltd

We engaged Kim to take the technical reigns on a large client project.

Kim was on point right from day one, diving head first into the work and committing himself to project delivery. Technically, Kim is **very sharp** with a good head for commercial software development. If there’s something strange in your development project, forget the Ghostbusters and give Kim Carter a call. 

Couldn’t recommended him highly enough.
