      <description>Few organisations understand the secrets of shifting the focus on security from late in the software development life-cycle to within the Development Team.
Not only does this significantly reduce the number of security defects being pushed to your production systems, but also significantly reduces the total cost of development.
Cheapest place to deal with defects There have been many studies specifically looking at the costs of finding and fixing defects early, as opposed to the planning of how to fix defects once the product is delivered, or not planning at all.</description>

      <description>Kim will explain the roles of &amp;rsquo;T&amp;rsquo; shaped professionals, including placement of security champions to create your purple Development Teams.
We will work through how to implement the Sensible Security Model (SSM) within each and every Sprint, including:
 Creating actionable countermeasure Product Backlog Items Integrating them into the same Product Backlog that your Development Team has been pulling business focussed items from Ordering them based on the risk ratings you create for each  Kim will discuss how and where Agile Development Teams often fail, along with how to succeed with security with a familiar anecdote.</description>

      <description>Kim will be covering:
 Threat modelling Developer security Physical security Social Engineering VPS security / hardening Network Security Cloud Security Application Security  There will be prizes worth working for, especially the team that takes first place.
If you want to win, I&amp;rsquo;d suggest getting familiar with the content in my book series.
Questions have also come from many other sources

      <description>Kim will then discuss and demo a set of light weight processes, practises and tools, that when combined have proven their value in:
 Aiding high throughput (reducing time to market) Significantly increasing quality (finding and removing bugs) Without de-scoping  and all while reducing total project cost (fact). If this sounds like breaking the laws of physics, or too good to be true, then this workshop is for you.</description>

      <description>The common payload takes the user supplied shellcode and overwrites the first 0x1000 bytes of the calling instance of PowerShell, creates a thread to execute within the virtual address space of the calling PowerShell instance and starts it.
All delivery and persistence techniques ensure AV bypass of shellcode.
Kim has dissected and will explain how the virus and payload works.
We will look at delivery mediums (virus):

      <description>The content is aimed at software engineers to teach them how to think holistically about security. The theme that runs through the training, and the book, is pulling the security focus that’s usually left until the end of the project or “go live” right into each Sprint. Baking security into the product from the cheapest possible place. Thus saving large amounts of money due to re-work and business asset loss. Kim will be teaching attendees a very simple threat modelling process initially blue printed by one of the best security experts the world has known, Bruce Schneier, then how to apply that process to a 10,000′ view and lower for a collection of areas:</description>

      <description>Join Kim in the exploration into an insightful set of steps he has learned, from an architectural perspective down to the zeros and ones. Also providing insights of how attackers of your systems think.
We will also look at other tried and tested practices and processes for reducing security defects early. That is every Sprint for each Product Backlog Item (PBI). As an architect, engineer and security specialist, Kim will uncover how to identify the lowest hanging fruit (for the attackers) by taking a holistic approach (a 30,000′ view), then honing in on the areas with the highest security ratings, based on a tried and tested threat modelling process that allows you to discover and prioritise the defects most likely to be compromised by attackers of your systems.</description>

      <title>Talk - Password Profiling, Brute Forcing</title>
      <link>https://binarymist.io/talk/toastmasters-2015-talk-password-profiling/</link>

      <guid>https://binarymist.io/talk/toastmasters-2015-talk-password-profiling/</guid>
      <description>Kim then takes the word-lists and analysis of failed and successful login attempts to a web application and educates a collection of brute-forcing tools what an unsuccessful and successful login looks like. Then run the brute-forcing tools until the credentials have been discovered. This demonstrates that common password strategies are no longer sufficient to stop full account compromise and worse.
This is followed up with some tips on how to make this process a lot harder for attackers.</description>

      <guid>https://binarymist.io/talk/toastmasters-2015-talk-infectious-media-with-rubber-ducky/</guid>
      <description>In this talk Kim walks through the psychology of why humans succumb to infectious media attacks and how the attacker is easily able to leverage the human weaknesses to do their bidding. This is a very useful and effective approach at getting inside a target organisation with no physical or network access.
 When the human weaknesses are coupled with the inherent trust of Human Interface Devices (HID) we have a recipe for success, or disaster depending on which side of the equation you are on.</description>
