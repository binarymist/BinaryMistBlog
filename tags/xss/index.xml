&lt;p&gt;In this article I’ll go over getting Kali Linux installed and set-up. I’ll go over a few of the packages in a low level of detail (due to the share number of them) that come out of the box. On top of that I’ll also go over a few programmes I like to install separately. In a subsequent article I’d like to continue with additional programmes that come with Kali Linux as there are just to many to cover in one go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A short time ago, I was tasked with finding the right software engineer/s for the organisation I was working for. I settled on a process, a set of background questions,  a set of practical programming exercises and a set of verbal questions. Later on I cut the set of verbal questions down to a quicker set. In this post, I’ll be going over the process and the full set of verbal questions. In a subsequent post I’ll go over the quicker set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Untrusted data (data entered by a user), should always be treated as though it contains attack code. This data should not be sent anywhere without taking the necessary steps to detect and neutralise the malicious code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was working on a web based project recently where there was no security thought about when designing, developing it. The following outlines my experience with retrofitting security. It’s my hope that someone will find it useful for their own implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
