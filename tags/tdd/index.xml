      <title>Consuming Free and Open Source</title>

&lt;p&gt;This is where A9 (Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities) of the 2013 OWASP Top 10 comes in. We are consuming far more free and open source libraries than we have ever before. Much of the code we are pulling into our projects is never intentionally used, but is still adding surface area for attack. In this post we address the risks and countermeasures.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Node.js Asynchronicity and Callback Nesting</title>
      <link>https://binarymist.io/blog/2014/07/26/node.js-asynchronicity-and-callback-nesting/</link>

&lt;p&gt;AKA callback hell, temple of doom, often the functions that are nested are anonymous and often they are implicit closures. When it comes to asynchronicity in JavaScript, callbacks are our bread and butter. In saying that, often the best way to use them is by abstracting them behind more elegant APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Software Engineer Interview Process and Questions</title>

&lt;p&gt;A short time ago, I was tasked with finding the right software engineer/s for the organisation I was working for. I settled on a process, a set of background questions,  a set of practical programming exercises and a set of verbal questions. Later on I cut the set of verbal questions down to a quicker set. In this post, I’ll be going over the process and the full set of verbal questions. In a subsequent post I’ll go over the quicker set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is your organisation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wanting to get more out of your Software Developers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wanting to increase RoI?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spending too much money fixing bugs?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Development team not releasing business value fast enough?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe your a software developer and you want to lift your game to the next level?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If any of these points are of concern to you… read on.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Moving to TDD</title>
      <link>https://binarymist.io/blog/2012/12/01/moving-to-tdd/</link>

&lt;p&gt;The first thing to clear up is that TDD is not primarily about testing, but rather it forces the developer to write code that is testable (the fact the code has tests written for it and running regularly is a side effect, albeit a very positive one).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to optimise your testing effort</title>
      <link>https://binarymist.io/blog/2012/03/24/how-to-optimise-your-testing-effort/</link>

&lt;p&gt;I recently wrote a post for the company I currently work for around the joys of doing TDD. What is your current approach to testing? How can you spend the little time you have on the most important areas? I thought I’d share some thoughts around where I see the optimal areas to invest your test effort.&lt;/p&gt;
