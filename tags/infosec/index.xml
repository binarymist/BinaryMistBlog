&lt;p&gt;This is where A9 (Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities) of the 2013 OWASP Top 10 comes in. We are consuming far more free and open source libraries than we have ever before. Much of the code we are pulling into our projects is never intentionally used, but is still adding surface area for attack. In this post we address the risks and countermeasures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best time to install a HIDS is on a fresh install before you open the host up to the internet or even your LAN if it’s corporate. Of course if you don’t have that luxury, there are a bunch of tools that can help you determine if you’re already owned. Be sure to run one or more over your target system before your HIDS bench-marks it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the ongoing work around preparing a Debian web server to host applications accessible from the WWW I performed some research, analysis, made decisions along the way and implemented a first stage logging strategy. I’ve done similar set-ups many times before, but thought it worth sharing my experience for all to learn something from it and/or provide input, recommendations, corrections to the process so we all get to improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article I’ll go over getting Kali Linux installed and set-up. I’ll go over a few of the packages in a low level of detail (due to the share number of them) that come out of the box. On top of that I’ll also go over a few programmes I like to install separately. In a subsequent article I’d like to continue with additional programmes that come with Kali Linux as there are just to many to cover in one go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Untrusted data (data entered by a user), should always be treated as though it contains attack code. This data should not be sent anywhere without taking the necessary steps to detect and neutralise the malicious code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was working on a web based project recently where there was no security thought about when designing, developing it. The following outlines my experience with retrofitting security. It’s my hope that someone will find it useful for their own implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been working on a small project that shuts down machines attached by network and of course power feed to an APC Smart-UPS. The code that was shutting down the guests required authentication to be passed to the receiving services.&lt;/p&gt;
