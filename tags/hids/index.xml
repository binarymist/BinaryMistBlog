&lt;p&gt;All the following offerings that I’ve evaluated target different scenarios. I’ve listed the pros and cons for each of them and where I think they fit into a potential solution to monitor your web applications (I’m leaning toward NodeJS) and make sure they keep running.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Evaluation of Host Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS)</title>
      <link>https://binarymist.io/blog/2015/05/30/evaluation-of-host-intrusion-detection-systems-hids/</link>

&lt;p&gt;The best time to install a HIDS is on a fresh install before you open the host up to the internet or even your LAN if it’s corporate. Of course if you don’t have that luxury, there are a bunch of tools that can help you determine if you’re already owned. Be sure to run one or more over your target system before your HIDS bench-marks it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Installation and Hardening of Debian Web Server</title>

&lt;p&gt;These are the steps I took to set-up and harden a Debian web server before being placed into a DMZ and undergoing additional hardening before opening the port from the WWW to it. Most of the steps below are fairly simple to do, and in doing so, remove a good portion of the low hanging fruit for nasty entities wanting to gain a foot-hold on your server-&amp;gt;network.&lt;/p&gt;
