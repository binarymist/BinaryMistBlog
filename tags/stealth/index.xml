      <description>&lt;p&gt;Redirects to legacy blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best time to install a HIDS is on a fresh install before you open the host up to the internet or even your LAN if it’s corporate. Of course if you don’t have that luxury, there are a bunch of tools that can help you determine if you’re already owned. Be sure to run one or more over your target system before your HIDS bench-marks it.&lt;/p&gt;
