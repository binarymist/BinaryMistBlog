      <description>Not being able to introspect your application at any given time or being able to know how the health status is, is not a comfortable place to be in and there is no reason you should be there.</description>

&lt;p&gt;The following is the process I found to set-up the pass-through of the very common USB TP-LINK TL-WN722N Wifi adapter (which is known to work well with Linux) to a Virtual Host Kali Linux 1.1.0 (same process for 2.0) guest, by-passing the Linux Mint 17.1 (Rebecca) Host.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Web Server Log Management</title>

&lt;p&gt;As part of the ongoing work around preparing a Debian web server to host applications accessible from the WWW I performed some research, analysis, made decisions along the way and implemented a first stage logging strategy. I’ve done similar set-ups many times before, but thought it worth sharing my experience for all to learn something from it and/or provide input, recommendations, corrections to the process so we all get to improve.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Up and Running with Kali Linux and Friends</title>

&lt;p&gt;In this article I’ll go over getting Kali Linux installed and set-up. I’ll go over a few of the packages in a low level of detail (due to the share number of them) that come out of the box. On top of that I’ll also go over a few programmes I like to install separately. In a subsequent article I’d like to continue with additional programmes that come with Kali Linux as there are just to many to cover in one go.&lt;/p&gt;
