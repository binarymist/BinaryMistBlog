      <description>&lt;p&gt;Redirects to legacy blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the ongoing work around preparing a Debian web server to host applications accessible from the WWW I performed some research, analysis, made decisions along the way and implemented a first stage logging strategy. Iâ€™ve done similar set-ups many times before, but thought it worth sharing my experience for all to learn something from it and/or provide input, recommendations, corrections to the process so we all get to improve.&lt;/p&gt;
