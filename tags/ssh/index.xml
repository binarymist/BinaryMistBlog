      <title>Installation and Hardening of Debian Web Server</title>

&lt;p&gt;These are the steps I took to set-up and harden a Debian web server before being placed into a DMZ and undergoing additional hardening before opening the port from the WWW to it. Most of the steps below are fairly simple to do, and in doing so, remove a good portion of the low hanging fruit for nasty entities wanting to gain a foot-hold on your server-&amp;gt;network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you connect to a remote host via SSH that you haven’t established a trust relationship with before, you’re going to be told that the authenticity of the host your attempting to connect to can’t be established.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>OpenSSH from Linux to Windows 7 via tunneled RDP</title>

&lt;p&gt;In this article I’ll go over getting Kali Linux installed and set-up. I’ll go over a few of the packages in a low level of detail (due to the share number of them) that come out of the box. On top of that I’ll also go over a few programmes I like to install separately. In a subsequent article I’d like to continue with additional programmes that come with Kali Linux as there are just to many to cover in one go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been intending for quite some time to setup an automated or at least a thoughtless one click backup procedure from my family members PC’s to a file server. Now if you put files directories in the place where we are going to rsync to, and run the command we’re going to setup, those new files directories will be deleted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change the default password in System|General|Password.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setup key pair authentication for SSH and secure FreeNAS.&lt;/p&gt;
