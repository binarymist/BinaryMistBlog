      <description>The OWASP ZAP HTTP intercepting proxy is useful for manually attacking your Web apps and APIs. Now, we have the official Node API to programatically drive ZAP to regression test our creations. Kim will show you how to build a &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/purpleteam-labs&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;fully featured security regression testing CLI&lt;/a&gt;, consumable by your CI/nightly builds.</description>

      <title>Moving to TDD</title>
      <link>https://binarymist.io/blog/2012/12/01/moving-to-tdd/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 01 Dec 2012 00:00:00 +1300</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://binarymist.io/blog/2012/12/01/moving-to-tdd/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Redirects to legacy blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing to clear up is that TDD is not primarily about testing, but rather it forces the developer to write code that is testable (the fact the code has tests written for it and running regularly is a side effect, albeit a very positive one).&lt;/p&gt;
