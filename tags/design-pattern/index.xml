      <title>Software Engineer Interview Process and Questions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Redirects to legacy blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A short time ago, I was tasked with finding the right software engineer/s for the organisation I was working for. I settled on a process, a set of background questions,  a set of practical programming exercises and a set of verbal questions. Later on I cut the set of verbal questions down to a quicker set. In this post, I’ll be going over the process and the full set of verbal questions. In a subsequent post I’ll go over the quicker set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the current set of coding standards and guidelines I use when I’m coding in the JavaScript language. I thought it would be good to share so others could get use out of them also, and maybe start a discussion as to amendments / changes they see that could be useful?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Keeping your events thread safe</title>

&lt;p&gt;An area I’ve noticed where engineers often forget to think about synchronization is when firing events. It seems to be a common misconception, that all that is needed to keep synchronisation, is to check the delegate (technically a &lt;code&gt;MulticastDelegate&lt;/code&gt;, or in architectural terms the publisher of the publish-subscribe pattern (more commonly known as the observer pattern)) for null.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was reading in the book Enterprise Integration Patterns that my dev manager bought for the team, on the Message Endpoint pattern on the way home from work a few days ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A Message Endpoint can be used to send messages or receive them, but one instance does not do both” From my experience, this wasn’t necessarily true. So I decided to confirm my suspicion.
The following is a mix of what I read and tested out.&lt;/p&gt;
