      <description>The security defaults of Docker are designed to get you up and running (“just work”) quickly, rather than being the most secure. There are many default configurations that can be improved upon. In this talk Kim will walk through improving the security of Docker hosts, containers, networking and deployments.</description>

&lt;p&gt;The following is the process I found to set-up the pass-through of the very common USB TP-LINK TL-WN722N Wifi adapter (which is known to work well with Linux) to a Virtual Host Kali Linux 1.1.0 (same process for 2.0) guest, by-passing the Linux Mint 17.1 (Rebecca) Host.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the following offerings that I’ve evaluated target different scenarios. I’ve listed the pros and cons for each of them and where I think they fit into a potential solution to monitor your web applications (I’m leaning toward NodeJS) and make sure they keep running.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Evaluation of Host Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS)</title>

&lt;p&gt;The best time to install a HIDS is on a fresh install before you open the host up to the internet or even your LAN if it’s corporate. Of course if you don’t have that luxury, there are a bunch of tools that can help you determine if you’re already owned. Be sure to run one or more over your target system before your HIDS bench-marks it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the ongoing work around preparing a Debian web server to host applications accessible from the WWW I performed some research, analysis, made decisions along the way and implemented a first stage logging strategy. I’ve done similar set-ups many times before, but thought it worth sharing my experience for all to learn something from it and/or provide input, recommendations, corrections to the process so we all get to improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this set-up, we’ve got one-to-many Linux servers in a network that all want to be synced with the same up-stream Network Time Protocol (NTP) server/s that your router (or what ever server you choose to be your NTP authority) uses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the steps I took to set-up and harden a Debian web server before being placed into a DMZ and undergoing additional hardening before opening the port from the WWW to it. Most of the steps below are fairly simple to do, and in doing so, remove a good portion of the low hanging fruit for nasty entities wanting to gain a foot-hold on your server-&amp;gt;network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article I’ll go over getting Kali Linux installed and set-up. I’ll go over a few of the packages in a low level of detail (due to the share number of them) that come out of the box. On top of that I’ll also go over a few programmes I like to install separately. In a subsequent article I’d like to continue with additional programmes that come with Kali Linux as there are just to many to cover in one go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been intending for quite some time to setup an automated or at least a thoughtless one click backup procedure from my family members PC’s to a file server. Now if you put files directories in the place where we are going to rsync to, and run the command we’re going to setup, those new files directories will be deleted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Message Inspectors can be a very usefull tool in diagnosing problems between WCF services and clients. The messages that are transferred between clients/services can be intercepted and operations performed on them. We’ve used this at work in conjunction with a tool called SaopUI to capture the SOAP messages and fire them at our service. This can be usefull for load testing, concurrency testing scenarios amongst others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was reading in the book Enterprise Integration Patterns that my dev manager bought for the team, on the Message Endpoint pattern on the way home from work a few days ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A Message Endpoint can be used to send messages or receive them, but one instance does not do both” From my experience, this wasn’t necessarily true. So I decided to confirm my suspicion.
The following is a mix of what I read and tested out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example, I share a listenUri between two endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setup key pair authentication for SSH and secure FreeNAS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Adding disks, CIFS/SMB shares to FreeNAS</title>

&lt;p&gt;What I did, was add a disk at a time (one each week, and stressed it for the entire week). This way the wear on the disk should be staggered and we are less likely to have all drives fail at the same time. Once I’d physically added all disks (ended up adding 4 x WD7500AACS for now).&lt;/p&gt;
