You could be saving significant expenditure on security and software development in general.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Is your organisation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wanting to get more out of your Software Developers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wanting to increase RoI?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spending too much money fixing bugs?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Development team not releasing business value fast enough?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe your a software developer and you want to lift your game to the next level?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If any of these points are of concern to you… read on.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Moving to TDD</title>
      <link>https://binarymist.io/blog/2012/12/01/moving-to-tdd/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Redirects to legacy blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing to clear up is that TDD is not primarily about testing, but rather it forces the developer to write code that is testable (the fact the code has tests written for it and running regularly is a side effect, albeit a very positive one).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following is the five steps we use to run our Retrospectives. I’ve purposely made these as terse as possible, so it can be used as a check list as the retrospective progresses. Below the five steps I’ve added some extra info and tips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently wrote a post for the company I currently work for around the joys of doing TDD. What is your current approach to testing? How can you spend the little time you have on the most important areas? I thought I’d share some thoughts around where I see the optimal areas to invest your test effort.&lt;/p&gt;
