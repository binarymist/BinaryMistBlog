      <description>The OWASP ZAP HTTP intercepting proxy is useful for manually attacking your Web apps and APIs. Now, we have the official Node API to programatically drive ZAP to regression test our creations. Kim will show you how to build a &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/purpleteam-labs&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;fully featured security regression testing CLI&lt;/a&gt;, consumable by your CI/nightly builds.</description>

      <title>Node.js Asynchronicity and Callback Nesting</title>
      <link>https://binarymist.io/blog/2014/07/26/node.js-asynchronicity-and-callback-nesting/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Redirects to legacy blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AKA callback hell, temple of doom, often the functions that are nested are anonymous and often they are implicit closures. When it comes to asynchronicity in JavaScript, callbacks are our bread and butter. In saying that, often the best way to use them is by abstracting them behind more elegant APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Redirects to legacy blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now establishing the formal definition has been quite an interesting journey, with quite a few sources not quite getting it right. Although the ES3 spec talks about closure, there is no formal definition of what it actually is. The ES5 spec on the other hand does discuss what closure is in two distinct locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Untrusted data (data entered by a user), should always be treated as though it contains attack code. This data should not be sent anywhere without taking the necessary steps to detect and neutralise the malicious code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was working on a web based project recently where there was no security thought about when designing, developing it. The following outlines my experience with retrofitting security. It’s my hope that someone will find it useful for their own implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
