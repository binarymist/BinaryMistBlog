      <description>The OWASP ZAP HTTP intercepting proxy is useful for manually attacking your Web apps and APIs. Now, we have the official Node API to programatically drive ZAP to regression test our creations. Kim will show you how to build a &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/purpleteam-labs&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;fully featured security regression testing CLI&lt;/a&gt;, consumable by your CI/nightly builds.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Redirects to legacy blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where A9 (Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities) of the 2013 OWASP Top 10 comes in. We are consuming far more free and open source libraries than we have ever before. Much of the code we are pulling into our projects is never intentionally used, but is still adding surface area for attack. In this post we address the risks and countermeasures.&lt;/p&gt;
