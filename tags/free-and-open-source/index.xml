&lt;p&gt;I’ve recently undertaken another round of evaluating .NET mocking (fake/substitute/dummy/stub/ or what ever you want to call them now) libraries. Interestingly the landscape has changed quite a bit since last time I went through this exercise, which was about two years ago. The outcome of the previous investigation is at the bottom of this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I had the opportunity for work, to carry out some research on what’s in the market in regards to bare-metal hypervisors. The following is the result of an in depth research and deployment project of the following bare-metal hyper-visors. This will enable us to trial the hypervisors out for performance, ease of setup, ease of administration, and ease of use.&lt;/p&gt;
