&lt;p&gt;This is where A9 (Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities) of the 2013 OWASP Top 10 comes in. We are consuming far more free and open source libraries than we have ever before. Much of the code we are pulling into our projects is never intentionally used, but is still adding surface area for attack. In this post we address the risks and countermeasures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AKA callback hell, temple of doom, often the functions that are nested are anonymous and often they are implicit closures. When it comes to asynchronicity in JavaScript, callbacks are our bread and butter. In saying that, often the best way to use them is by abstracting them behind more elegant APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a result of a lot of trial and error, reading, notes taken, advice from more knowledgeable people than myself over a period of a few months in my spare time. This is the basis of a web site Iâ€™m writing for a new business endeavour.&lt;/p&gt;
