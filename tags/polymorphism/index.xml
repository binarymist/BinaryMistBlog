&lt;p&gt;My intention with this post is to arm our developers with enough information around JavaScript prototypes to know when they are the right tool for the job as opposed to other constructs when considering how to create polymorphic JavaScript that’s performant and easy to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Software Engineer Interview Process and Questions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Redirects to legacy blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A short time ago, I was tasked with finding the right software engineer/s for the organisation I was working for. I settled on a process, a set of background questions,  a set of practical programming exercises and a set of verbal questions. Later on I cut the set of verbal questions down to a quicker set. In this post, I’ll be going over the process and the full set of verbal questions. In a subsequent post I’ll go over the quicker set.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Moving to TDD</title>

&lt;p&gt;The first thing to clear up is that TDD is not primarily about testing, but rather it forces the developer to write code that is testable (the fact the code has tests written for it and running regularly is a side effect, albeit a very positive one).&lt;/p&gt;
