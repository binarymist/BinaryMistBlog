      <description>&lt;p&gt;Redirects to legacy blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A short time ago, I was tasked with finding the right software engineer/s for the organisation I was working for. I settled on a process, a set of background questions,  a set of practical programming exercises and a set of verbal questions. Later on I cut the set of verbal questions down to a quicker set. In this post, I’ll be going over the process and the full set of verbal questions. In a subsequent post I’ll go over the quicker set.&lt;/p&gt;
