&lt;p&gt;This is where A9 (Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities) of the 2013 OWASP Top 10 comes in. We are consuming far more free and open source libraries than we have ever before. Much of the code we are pulling into our projects is never intentionally used, but is still adding surface area for attack. In this post we address the risks and countermeasures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Untrusted data (data entered by a user), should always be treated as though it contains attack code. This data should not be sent anywhere without taking the necessary steps to detect and neutralise the malicious code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was working on a web based project recently where there was no security thought about when designing, developing it. The following outlines my experience with retrofitting security. It’s my hope that someone will find it useful for their own implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
