      <description>Your Development Team(s) are struggling to create secure software. Your business is paying too much for security reviews, and penetration testing at the end of the project.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your customers want to be certain that their personal data is secure. You could be saving significant expenditure on security and software development in general.</description>

&lt;p&gt;All the following offerings that I’ve evaluated target different scenarios. I’ve listed the pros and cons for each of them and where I think they fit into a potential solution to monitor your web applications (I’m leaning toward NodeJS) and make sure they keep running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best time to install a HIDS is on a fresh install before you open the host up to the internet or even your LAN if it’s corporate. Of course if you don’t have that luxury, there are a bunch of tools that can help you determine if you’re already owned. Be sure to run one or more over your target system before your HIDS bench-marks it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Web Server Log Management</title>

&lt;p&gt;As part of the ongoing work around preparing a Debian web server to host applications accessible from the WWW I performed some research, analysis, made decisions along the way and implemented a first stage logging strategy. I’ve done similar set-ups many times before, but thought it worth sharing my experience for all to learn something from it and/or provide input, recommendations, corrections to the process so we all get to improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this set-up, we’ve got one-to-many Linux servers in a network that all want to be synced with the same up-stream Network Time Protocol (NTP) server/s that your router (or what ever server you choose to be your NTP authority) uses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the steps I took to set-up and harden a Debian web server before being placed into a DMZ and undergoing additional hardening before opening the port from the WWW to it. Most of the steps below are fairly simple to do, and in doing so, remove a good portion of the low hanging fruit for nasty entities wanting to gain a foot-hold on your server-&amp;gt;network.&lt;/p&gt;
