      <description>&lt;p&gt;Redirects to legacy blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article I’ll go over getting Kali Linux installed and set-up. I’ll go over a few of the packages in a low level of detail (due to the share number of them) that come out of the box. On top of that I’ll also go over a few programmes I like to install separately. In a subsequent article I’d like to continue with additional programmes that come with Kali Linux as there are just to many to cover in one go.&lt;/p&gt;
