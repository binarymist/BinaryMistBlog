      <description>Your Development Team(s) are struggling to create secure software. Your business is paying too much for security reviews, and penetration testing at the end of the project.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your customers want to be certain that their personal data is secure. You could be saving significant expenditure on security and software development in general.</description>

&lt;p&gt;A short time ago, I was tasked with finding the right software engineer/s for the organisation I was working for. I settled on a process, a set of background questions,  a set of practical programming exercises and a set of verbal questions. Later on I cut the set of verbal questions down to a quicker set. In this post, I’ll be going over the process and the full set of verbal questions. In a subsequent post I’ll go over the quicker set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following is the five steps we use to run our Retrospectives. I’ve purposely made these as terse as possible, so it can be used as a check list as the retrospective progresses. Below the five steps I’ve added some extra info and tips.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Redirects to legacy blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently wrote a post for the company I currently work for around the joys of doing TDD. What is your current approach to testing? How can you spend the little time you have on the most important areas? I thought I’d share some thoughts around where I see the optimal areas to invest your test effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, it’s my intention to bring some clarity to the following question. Why does a business decide to employ Scrum as the chosen framework that their development team/s use for managing the business’s projects / work items?&lt;/p&gt;
