&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.se-radio.net/team/kim-carter/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://binarymist.io/img/publication/se-radio-logo.png&#34; alt=&#34;Software Engineering Radio&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;show-outline&#34;&gt;Show Outline&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;container-networking-stack&#34;&gt;Container Networking Stack&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is container networking, and why do we need to network containers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let’s talk a bit about what the networking stack is comprised of when it comes to containers. Can you explain briefly the three layers:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low-level networking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Container networking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Container orchestration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We talked a bit about how most networks today are becoming the responsibility of Software Engineers in show &lt;a href=&#34;https://binarymist.io/publication/ser-podcast-network-security&#34;&gt;#302 Network Security with Haroon Meer&lt;/a&gt;. I also cover this in my book “&lt;a href=&#34;https://binarymist.io/publication/cloud-security&#34;&gt;Cloud Security&lt;/a&gt;”. Can you explain what Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is, and why Software Engineers need to understand it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;single-host-container-networking&#34;&gt;Single-Host Container Networking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are four single host networking modes based on the four Linux kernel network namespace drivers.

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bridge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;host (faster, less secure)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;container&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;none&lt;br /&gt;
Can you give us a description of these modes, what they give us, how they work, and where we would use each one?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In terms of allocating IP addresses, the bridge mode mostly takes care of this, what about the other modes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In terms of managing ports, we have fixed and dynamic port allocation. How do each of these work, and in which cases would we use each one?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are quite a few things to consider in terms of network security with Docker containers. By default, containers on the same host can communicate with each other due to &lt;code&gt;--icc=true&lt;/code&gt; which means comms work by default, but there are risks that need to be considered. What are these risks, and how do Engineers mitigate them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If one container gets compromised, it could potentially access other containers on the host and compromise them also. What else do we need to be thinking about in order to provide solid configuration and mitigation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;multi-host-container-networking&#34;&gt;Multi-Host Container Networking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We’re going to dive into the section within your book on Multi-Host Container Networking now, just before we do, can you give a quick explanation of what IpTables is?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to the Docker networking communication docs:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With the section on &lt;em&gt;Communicating to the outside world&lt;/em&gt; stating &lt;em&gt;Docker’s forward rules permit all external source IPs by default&lt;/em&gt;. So by default, any interface outside of the host can access the hosts container&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then the section on &lt;em&gt;Container communication between hosts&lt;/em&gt; states &lt;em&gt;Docker sets the default policy of the iptables FORWARD chain to DROP&lt;/em&gt;, so a host receiving comms from the outside does not by default forward them on to the hosts container&lt;br /&gt;
Can you explain what actually happens here? What are the actual defaults with inter-host comms of containers, how when and why should Engineers go about changing this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is an overlay network?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does Dockers support for overlay networks look like?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you go about creating an overlay network?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What’s the difference between an overlay network and a swarm?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we encrypt traffic between all containers on an overlay network?
&lt;code&gt;docker network create --opt encrypted --driver overlay&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are some of the network plugins Docker provides, and how do you use them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you give us a run-down on the following multi-host container networking options, along with their pros and cons:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flannel by CoreOS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WeaveNet by Weaveworks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project Calico by Metaswitch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open vSwitch from the OpenStack project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OpenVpn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What sort of issues arise out of IP address management and how are these addressed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;orchestration&#34;&gt;Orchestration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is container orchestration, tell us a bit about the different roles involved?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;organisational primitives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scheduling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automated health checks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Autoscaling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;upgrade strategies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;service discovery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the main players/products in container orchestration, and what platforms do they run on?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the organisational primitives that exist, what are they used for and responsible for?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;kubernetes-networking&#34;&gt;Kubernetes Networking&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give us a rundown on what Kubernetes is, and what the problem is that it’s trying to solve?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the main components in Kubernetes, and what are they responsible for?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give us a bit of an overview of Kubernetes networking?
Containers can communicate with all other containers without NAT
Nodes can communicate with all containers (and vice versa) without NAT
The IP a container sees itself is the same IP as others see it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell us a bit about how Kubernetes does:&lt;br /&gt;
Intra-pod networking (container mode networking (all containers share the same IP), isn’t this a security flaw?)&lt;br /&gt;
Inter-pod networking&lt;br /&gt;
Ingress and egress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the different options for service discovery in Kubernetes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell us a bit about how service meshes work in Kubernetes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;service-discovery&#34;&gt;Service Discovery&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In terms of registering a container, what happens when the scheduler dies and the registered containers keep running, essentially the containers are now running rogue?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are a few service discovery tools listed in your book Container Networking, such as ZooKeeper, etcd, Consul and a couple of others. Do the orchestrator solutions not have their own service discovery tools?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell us a bit about the service discovery solutions available, where they shine, and not so much?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You also mention a collection of load balancing tools in your book, do the orchestration solutions not have their own integrated load balancers, and if not, how do you go about integrating a load balancer?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;container-network-interface&#34;&gt;Container Network Interface&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell us a bit about the Container Network Interface (CNI), Docker’s libnetwork and how they differ?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are some of the CNI plugins and what are they responsible for?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Natalie Silvanovich on Attack Surface Reduction</title>
      <link>https://binarymist.io/publication/ser-podcast-attack-surface-reduction/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 17 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://binarymist.io/publication/ser-podcast-attack-surface-reduction/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.se-radio.net/team/kim-carter/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://binarymist.io/img/publication/se-radio-logo.png&#34; alt=&#34;Software Engineering Radio&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;show-outline&#34;&gt;Show Outline&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;basic-questions&#34;&gt;Basic Questions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you explain what attack surface is?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we are to reduce attack surface, we need to be able to measure it. How would you go about quantifying the attack surface before and after defects have been found and fixed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does your threat modelling approach take into consideration the severity as well as number of defects?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m working on a project. I’ve measured my attack surface, found and fixed some defects, measured again, and the attack surface is now 10% smaller. Is my project now 10% more secure?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You mentioned in your “Small is Beautiful” talk that we should:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Base features on user need&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Track feature use in beta or production&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be willing/able to disable features
This is great advice, is this assuming we have zero users consuming a specific feature?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you go into a little more depth on this?&lt;br /&gt;
(concrete examples of how you do this?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You also mentioned that all code has risk, and that adding a feature is a trade-off. I’d go much further than this, by saying all features are trade-offs, including physical, people, vps, networks, cloud, mobile and IoT. We need to consider the attack surface of everything.&lt;br /&gt;
Can we apply the previous question and your answer to all of these areas, and if so, how so?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;developers-current-state&#34;&gt;Developers - Current State&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you explain how you are “significantly reducing the number of people harmed by targeted attacks” when any number of bugs that the &lt;a href=&#34;https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/list?can=1&amp;amp;redir=1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Project Zero&lt;/a&gt; team identifies appear to be completely swamped by the continual onslaught of Developers continuing to create security defects in just about everything produced?&lt;br /&gt;
(Because you focus on the most heavily used software)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was a post on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.npmjs.org/post/172774747080/attitudes-to-security-in-the-javascript-community&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;NPM blog&lt;/a&gt; recently called: “Attitudes to security in the JavaScript community” in which 87% of respondents said they were concerned with the security of the code they wrote themselves, compared to only 77% saying the same about open source. This to me sounds like the wakeup call the security community has been pushing for years is starting to be heard.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are your thoughts on these statistics, do they sound realistic, are you noticing a similar trend in Developers taking security more seriously?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What’s your experience and/or thoughts on where the level of security defects are in JavaScript compared to other languages and their environments?&lt;br /&gt;
What are your thoughts on these statistics and how can we continue to improve them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we go about considering the security impact of features at design time? Do we need a Red Teamer as part of the Development Team to help drive out defects before we introduce them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;code-sharing&#34;&gt;Code Sharing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You mentioned in your “Small is Beautiful” talk that using the same code for multiple purposes can expose it to new and unnecessary attack vectors. While I believe this to be true, code sharing can be a good thing in terms of productivity. High fan in on pieces of code has been an aim of the Development community for a long time. What are your thoughts on rather than telling Developers not to re-use code, we should be trying to help them create more secure pieces of code that can be consumed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You also mentioned that multiple copies of the same code can be difficult to maintain. I’ve noticed with microservices becoming more popular, this seems to be happening more. Do you have any advice other than pulling the common code out into a separate package and consuming as a library?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you tell us about the Android WebView issues where several Android features contained their own version of WebView, bugs were fixed in one version but not another, then they unified WebView?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;third-party-code&#34;&gt;Third-party Code&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I discuss this in depth in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap06.html#web-applications&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Web Applications&lt;/a&gt; chapter of my book &lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Fascicle 1&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;https://holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Holistic Info-Sec for Web Developers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
(&lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap06.html#web-applications-identify-risks-consuming-free-and-open-source&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;risks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap06.html#web-applications-countermeasures-consuming-free-and-open-source&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;countermeasures&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In your “Small is Beautiful” talk, you mention:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That we should “make sure each attack surface only supports needed features”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Avoid multiple copies of the same library”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are both concepts that the Node Package Management ecosystem at least violates. Developers consume vast numbers of packages, even in small projects, often consuming a package to use only one of many features consumed. Firstly, for our listeners, explain what the problem is here?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where is the point where you would write something yourself as opposed to consume?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ve also mentioned tracking third-party software use and having an internal process for use, which I’ve also discussed in my previously mentioned book. Can you explain how you would do this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As we’re on the topic of third-party code management, can you tell us about the example of CVE-2916-4117, that’s the remote code execution in the FireEye Malware Protection System?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there tools that you would like to see automated as part of our DevSecOps process that you think would help the third-party code problems?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are smaller packages the answer? If so, do we have the package management systems capable of managing very small packages? I mean, how would discoverability work, it’s hard enough now trying to find the most suitable package out of 10 that all do the same thing right?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m thinking of your “a puppy is forever slide” in your Small is Beautiful talk&amp;hellip; Currently if we depend on a package that the maintainer isn’t keeping patched, we need to fork and maintain it ourselves. Where do you see this ending up?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a) Node Security Project (NSP) was acquired by NPM on April 10&lt;br /&gt;
b) Github is now providing visibility into the dependencies of their users repos and alerting on known security issues if they have a Common Vulnerability Exposure (CVE)&lt;br /&gt;
c) Snyke Provides something similar, but they’ve been doing this for much longer than Github and know of many more issues.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are your thoughts on how the open source ecosystem is progressing in terms of creating visibility around defective code?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can we do better?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;developer-workflow&#34;&gt;Developer Workflow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In your “Small is Beautiful” talk you mentioned that excessive SKUs and branching:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make it harder to push security updates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can introduce bugs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can cause incomplete patching&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I think few would disagree with this, a well defined and sometimes elaborate branching scheme is necessary for large groups of Software Engineers all collaborating on the same code base. Can you define excessive in this context?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you talk a bit about CVE-2017-0528, that’s the merge error in Android reducing ASLR bits, what happened with this and what were the lessons that were learnt?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before the show you mentioned you also had some anonymised examples of bugs:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where a vendor failed to patch a security issue due to a complex branching and build system, and their patches were also taking a long time due to this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How would you propose minimal SKUs and branches in a large project where say 100 Engineers are working on the same project?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ve talked a bit about:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pruning trees regularly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making sure all code has an owner&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you explain what you mean by this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What recommendations do you have for reducing the chances of introducing defects due to branching and merging?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;defects&#34;&gt;Defects&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you tell us a bit about the Samsung image processing defect (CVE-2015-7894), that’s the one where the very old QJpeg library was added to parse the android splash images, but it was somehow added to the Android image subsystem, so that all images from a low privileged user are parsed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let’s talk about CVE-2017-3558, that’s the Memory corruption issue in VirtualBox, allowing guest-to-host escalation. You mentioned this was due to old code not being fully removed? It was fixed upstream, but not downstream? Can you talk a bit about this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What could have been done so that this never happened?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CVE-2015-7894, that’s the 7 memory corruption issues in Samsung S6 Edge image processing. This was due to old / no longer used code being left in the system? Can you talk a bit about this one?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What could have been done so that this never happened?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You mentioned that the following bugs were in the JavaScript engines, not the language JavaScript:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you tell us about the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-17/thursday/us-17-Silvanovich-The-Origin-Of-Array-Symbol-Species.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Array.species&lt;/a&gt; bug (CVE-2016-7200), the issue with Array.filter in MS Edge?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What was the Array index accessor bug (CVE-2017-2447) in Safari’s Function.bind?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What about the TypedArray.sort defect in MS Edge (CVE-2016-7288)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You mentioned in one of your talks that standards can lead to security issues, can you explain what you meant by that?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <pubDate>Sat, 28 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +1200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://binarymist.io/blog/2018/04/28/cloud-security/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Following on from last months news of my new &lt;a href=&#34;https://binarymist.io/blog/2018/03/31/docker-security/&#34;&gt;Docker Security - Quick Reference&lt;/a&gt; book, I bring you &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/publication/cloud-security/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Cloud Security - Quick Reference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book is purposed to help Software Developers/DevOps Engineers, and also the likes of Product Owner and Product Manager types gain a good understanding of the risks and countermeasures when dealing with Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) and your environments within.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are quite a few anecdotes based on my own experience consulting for organisations navigating the perils of the many Cloud environments available today, along with tips, tricks, tools, advice, and implementation details from many client lessons learnt the hard way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also be sure to have a listen to the show on &lt;a href=&#34;https://binarymist.io/publication/ser-podcast-cloud-security/&#34;&gt;Cloud Security&lt;/a&gt; I recorded with Scott Piper (AWS Cloud Specialist) as guest for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.se-radio.net/team/kim-carter/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Software Engineering Radio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is a snapshot of what you can expect inside of the book, laid out in the Sensible Security Model (SSM) threat modelling approach:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asset Identification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify Risks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Countermeasures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risks that Solution Causes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Costs and Trade-offs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oh, and for less than the cost of a lunch you can own the complete book&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;cloud-identify-risks-shared-responsibility-model&#34;&gt;Shared Responsibility Model&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shared responsibility model is one that many have not grasped or understood well. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at the responsibilities of the parties involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;cloud-identify-risks-shared-responsibility-model-csp-responsibility&#34;&gt;CSP Responsibility&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CSP takes care of the infrastructure, not the customer specific configuration of it. Due to the sheer scale of what they are building, the CSP is often able to build in good security controls, in contrast to the average system administrator, who has limited resources or ability to focus on security to the same degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, due to sheer scale, the average CSP has a concentrated group of good security professionals versus a business who&amp;rsquo;s core focus is often not security related. CSPs provide good security mechanisms, but the customer has to know and care enough to use them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSPs who architect infrastructure, build components, frameworks, hardware, and platform software in most cases take security seriously and are doing a reasonable job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;cloud-identify-risks-shared-responsibility-model-csp-customer-responsibility&#34;&gt;CSP Customer Responsibility&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSP customers are expected to be responsible for their own security as it pertains to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Their people working with the technology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://binarymist.io/tags/application-security/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Application security&lt;/a&gt;, specific to shortcomings in people: lack of skills, experience, engagement, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configuring the infrastructure and/or platform components, again referencing people defects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All too often the customer&amp;rsquo;s responsibility is neglected, which renders the Cloud no better for the customer in terms of security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary problem with the Cloud is this: customers have the misconception that someone else is taking care of all their security. That is not how the shared responsibility model works though. Yes, the CSP is probably taking care of infrastructure security, but other forms of security as listed above are even more important than before the shift to the Cloud. These items are now the lowest hanging fruit for the attacker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following are a set of questions (verbatim) I have been asked recently, and that I hear similar versions of frequently:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;As a software engineer, do I really care about physical network security and network logging?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Surely &amp;ldquo;as a software engineer&amp;rdquo;, I can just use TLS and that is the end of it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;If the machine is compromised, do we give up on security because we aren&amp;rsquo;t responsible for the network?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is the difference between application security and network security? Aren&amp;rsquo;t they just two aspects of the same thing?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;If I have implemented TLS for communication, have I fixed all of the network security problems?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;cloud-identify-risks-csp-evaluation&#34;&gt;CSP Evaluation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSPs are constantly changing their terms and conditions, as well as many other components and aspects of what they offer. I have compiled a set of must-answer questions to quiz your CSP with as part of your threat modelling before (or even after) you sign their service agreement.&lt;br /&gt;
Most of these questions were already part of my &lt;a href=&#34;https://binarymist.io/talk/saturn-2015-talk-does-your-cloud-solution-look-like-a-mushroom/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Cloud vs In-house talk&lt;/a&gt; at the Saturn Architects conference I spoke at. I recommend using these as a basis for identifying risks that are important for you to consider. This should make you well armed to come up with countermeasures and think of any additional risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you keep a signed audit log of what actions users performed, and when, via UIs and APIs?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both authorised and unauthorised users are more careful about the actions they take, or do not take, when they know their actions are being recorded and are potentially being watched&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you enact the shared responsibility model between CSPs and their customers? Please explain your role and my role in the protection of my and my customers data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will almost certainly not have complete control over the data you entrust to your CSP, but they will also not assume responsibility over the data you entrust to them, or how it is accessed. One example of this might be, how do you preserve secrecy for data at rest? For example, are you using the most suitable Key Derivation Function (KDF) as I discuss in depth in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap06.html#web-applications-countermeasures-data-store-compromise-which-kdf-to-use&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Web Applications chapter&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;http://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Holistic Info-Sec for Web Developers, Fascicle 1&lt;/a&gt; and adjusting the number of iterations applied each year (as discussed in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap06.html#web-applications-countermeasures-lack-of-authentication-authorisation-session-management-technology-and-design-decisions-membershipreboot&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;MembershipReboot&lt;/a&gt; subsection of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap06.html#web-applications&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Web Applications chapter&lt;/a&gt; of Holistic Info-Sec for Web Developers Fascicle 1) to the secrets stored in your data stores? The data you hand over to your CSP is no more secure than I discuss in the Management of Application Secrets subsections of the Web Applications chapter of Holistic Info-Sec for Web Developers Fascicle 1, and in many cases has the potential to be less secure for some of the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An often encountered false assumption is that somehow the data you provide is safer by default on your CSP&amp;rsquo;s network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your CSP can be forced by governing authorities to give up the data you entrust to them, as we discuss in the &lt;a href=&#34;#cloud-identify-risks-cloud-service-provider-vs-in-house-giving-up-secrets&#34;&gt;Giving up Secrets&lt;/a&gt; subsection&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you encrypt all communications between servers within your data centres as well as your service providers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How is your data encrypted in transit (as discussed in the Management of Application Secrets subsections of the Web Applications chapter)? In reality, you have no idea what paths it will take once in your CSPs possession, and could very well be intercepted without your knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have little to no control over the network path that the data you provide will travel on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are more parties involved in your CSPs infrastructure than on your own network&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you provide access to logs, if so, what sort of access, and to what sort of logs?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully you will have easy access to any and all logs, just as you would if it was your own network. That includes hosts, routing, firewall, and any other service logs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is your process around terminating my contract with you and/or moving to another CSP?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No CSP is going to last forever, termination or migration is inevitable, it is just a matter of when&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where do your servers, processes and data reside physically?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we discuss a little later in the Cloud Services Provider vs In-house subsection of Countermeasures, your data is governed by different people and jurisdictions depending on where it physically resides. CSPs have data centres in different countries and jurisdictions, each having different data security laws&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who can view the data I store in the Cloud?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who has access to view this data? What checks and controls are in place to make sure that this data cannot be exfiltrated?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is your Service Level Agreement (SLA) for uptime?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure you are aware of what the uptime promises mean in terms of real time. Some CSPs will allow 99.95% uptime if you are running on a single availability zone, but closer to 100% if you run on multiple availability zones. Some CSPs do not have a SLA at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSPs will often provide credits for the downtime, but these credits in many cases may not cover the losses you encounter during high traffic events&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you ISO/IEC 27001:2013 Certified? If so, what is within its scope?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the CSP can answer this with a &amp;ldquo;everything&amp;rdquo; and prove it, they have done a lot of work to make this possible. This shows a certain level of commitment to their security posture. Just be aware, as with any certification, it is just that, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily prove sound security&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you allow your customers to carry out regular penetration testing of production and/or test environments, and allow the network to be in-scope?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSPs that allow penetration testing of their environments demonstrate that they embrace transparency and openness. If their networks stand up to penetration tests they obviously take security seriously. Ideally, this is what you are looking for. CSPs that do not permit penetration testing of their environments are usually trying to hide something. It may be that they know they have major insecurities, or a skills shortage in terms of security professionals. Worse, they may be unaware of where their security stature lies and are not willing to have their faults demonstrated&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you have bug bounty programmes running, if so, what do they look like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another example if their programme is run well, it conveys that the CSP is open and transparent about their security faults and are willing to mitigate them as soon as possible&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;cloud-identify-risks-storage-of-secrets-private-key-abuse-ssh&#34;&gt;SSH&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap03.html#vps-countermeasures-disable-remove-services-harden-what-is-left-ssh&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SSH&lt;/a&gt; key-pair auth is no better than password auth if it is abused in the following way, in-fact it may even be worse. I have seen some organisations who store a single private key with no pass-phrase for all of their EC2 instances in their developer wiki. All or many of the developers have access to this, with the idea being that they just copy the key from the wiki to their local &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh/&lt;/code&gt;. There are a number of things wrong with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Private key is not private if it is shared amongst the team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No pass-phrase, means no second factor of authentication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because there is only one user (single key-pair) being used on the VPSs, there is also no audit trail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The weakest link is the weakest wiki password of all the developers, and we all know how weak that is likely to be, with a bit of reconnaissance, probably guessable in a few attempts without any password profiling tools. I have discussed this and demonstrated a collection of password profiling tools in the &amp;ldquo;Weak Password Strategies&amp;rdquo; subsection of the People chapter of &lt;a href=&#34;https://f0.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Fascicle 0&lt;/a&gt;. Once the attacker has the weakest password, then they own all of the EC2 (if on AWS) instances, or any resource that is using key-pair authentication. If the organisation is failing this badly, then they almost certainly will not have any password complexity constraints on their wiki either&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most developers will also blindly accept what they think are the server key fingerprints without verifying them, which opens them up to a MItM attack, as discussed in the VPS chapter under the &lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap03.html#vps-countermeasures-disable-remove-services-harden-what-is-left-ssh-establishing-your-ssh-servers-key-fingerprint&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SSH subsection&lt;/a&gt;. This quickly moves from just being a technical issue to a cultural one, where people are trained to accept that the server is who it says it is. The fact that they have to verify the fingerprint is essentially a step that gets in their way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;cloud-identify-risks-storage-of-secrets-private-key-abuse-tls&#34;&gt;TLS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Docker reads the instructions in the following &lt;code&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/code&gt;, an image is created that copies your certificate, private key, and any other secrets you have declared, and adds them to an additional layer and forms the resulting image. Both &lt;code&gt;COPY&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ADD&lt;/code&gt; will bake what ever you are copying or adding into an additional layer or delta, as discussed in the Consumption from Registries subsection in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://binarymist.io/publication/docker-security/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Docker Security book&lt;/a&gt;. Whoever can access this image from a public or less public registry now has access to your certificate and even worse your private key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone can see how these images were built using the following tools:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/CenturyLinkLabs/dockerfile-from-image&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;dockerfile-from-image&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://imagelayers.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ImageLayers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;ENV&lt;/code&gt; command similarly adds the &lt;code&gt;dirty little secret&lt;/code&gt; value as the &lt;code&gt;mySecret&lt;/code&gt; key into the image layer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&#34;private-key-abuse-with-dockerfile&#34;&gt;Private key abuse with Dockerfile&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;FROM nginx

&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# ...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;COPY /host-path/star.mydomain.com.cert /etc/nginx/certs/my.cert
COPY /host-path/star.mydomain.com.key /etc/nginx/certs/my.key
ENV mySecret&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;dirty little secret&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
COPY /host-path/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf 
# ...&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;cloud-countermeasures-violations-of-least-privilege&#34;&gt;Violations of &lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap06.html#web-applications-countermeasures-management-of-application-secrets-least-privilege&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Least Privilege&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you create IAM policies, grant only the permissions required to perform the task(s) necessary for given users. If the user needs additional permissions, then they can be added, rather than adding everything up front and potentially having to remove again at some stage. Adding as required, rather than removing as required, will cause much less friction technically and socially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For example, &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;in AWS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, you need to keep a close watch on which &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_permissions.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;permissions&lt;/a&gt; are assigned to &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;policies&lt;/a&gt; that your groups and roles have applied, and subsequently, which groups and roles your users are in or part of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the recommended sequence for granting least privilege in AWS, other CSPs will be similar:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, work out which permissions a given user requires&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create or select an existing group or role&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attach policy to the group or role that has the permissions that your given user requires. You can select existing policies or create new ones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the given user to the group or role&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regularly review all of the IAM policies you are using, making sure only the required permissions (Services, Access Levels, and Resources) are available to the users and/or groups attached to the specific policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enable &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#enable-mfa-for-privileged-users&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Multi Factor Authentication&lt;/a&gt; (MFA) on the root user, and all IAM users with console access, especially privileged users at a minimum. AWS provides the ability to mandate that users use MFA, you can do this by creating a new managed policy based on the AWS guidance to &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_users-self-manage-mfa-and-creds.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Enable Your Users to Configure Their Own Credentials and MFA Settings&lt;/a&gt;. Attach the new policy to a group that you have created and add users that must use MFA to that group.&lt;br /&gt;
This process was pointed out to me by Scott Piper during our &lt;a href=&#34;https://binarymist.io/publication/ser-podcast-cloud-security/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Cloud Security interview&lt;/a&gt; by way of his &lt;a href=&#34;https://duo.com/blog/potential-gaps-in-suggested-amazon-web-services-security-policies-for-mfa&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; and generous Github pull request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/remove-unnecessary-permissions-in-your-iam-policies-by-using-service-last-accessed-data/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Access Advisor&lt;/a&gt; tab, is visible on the IAM console details page for Users, Groups, Roles, or Policies after you select a list item. This provides information about which services are accessible for any of your users, groups, or roles. This can also be helpful for auditing permissions that should not be available to any of your users who are part of the group, role or policy you selected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_testing-policies.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;IAM Policy Simulator&lt;/a&gt; is accessible from the IAM console. This is good for granular reporting on the permissions of your specific Users, Groups and Roles, filtered by service and actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/trustedadvisor/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;AWS Trusted Advisor&lt;/a&gt; should be run periodically to check for security issues. It is accessible from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://console.aws.amazon.com/trustedadvisor/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Console&lt;/a&gt;, CLI and API. Trusted Advisor has a collection of core checks and recommendations which are free to use. These include security groups, specific ports unrestricted, IAM use, MFA on root user, EBS and RDS public snapshots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Running services as root&lt;/strong&gt;: Make sure that Docker containers are not running under the root account. There are full details in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://binarymist.io/publication/docker-security/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Docker Security book&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Configuration Settings Changed Ad Hoc&lt;/strong&gt;: One option is to have solid change control in place. &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/config/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;AWS Config&lt;/a&gt; can assist with this. &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;AWS Config&lt;/a&gt; continuously monitors and records how the AWS resources were configured and how they have changed, including how they are related to each other. This enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources, and have notifications sent to you when AWS Config detects a violation, including created, modified or deleted rules changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS Config records IAM policies assigned to users, groups, or roles, and EC2 security groups, including port rules. Changes to your configuration settings can trigger Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) notifications, which you can have sent to your personnel tasked with controlling changes to your configurations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your custom rules can be codified and therefore source controlled. AWS calls this Compliance as Code. I discussed AWS CloudTrail briefly in item 1 of the &lt;a href=&#34;#cloud-countermeasures-csp-evaluation&#34;&gt;CSP Evaluation&lt;/a&gt; countermeasures subsection. AWS Config is integrated with CloudTrail, which captures all API calls from AWS Config console or API, SDKs, CLI tools, and other AWS services. The information collected by CloudTrail provides insight on what request was made, from which IP address, by who, and when&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Machine Instance Access To Open&lt;/strong&gt;: Reduce your attack surface by disabling access to your machine instances from &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; source IP address&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also a collection of IAM specific items that you should review in the Identity and Access Management subsection of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/compliance/AWS_CIS_Foundations_Benchmark.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CIS AWS Foundations document&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;cloud-countermeasures-violations-of-least-privilege-machine-instance-single-user-root&#34;&gt;Machine Instance Single User Root&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the VPS and container builds, there should be &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/managing-users.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;specific users created&lt;/a&gt; for specific jobs, every user within your organisation that needs VPS access should have their own user account on every VPS, including &lt;a href=&#34;#cloud-countermeasures-storage-of-secrets-private-key-abuse-ssh&#34;&gt;SSH access&lt;/a&gt; if required (ideally this should be automated). With Docker, I discussed how this is done in the &lt;code&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/code&gt; in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://binarymist.io/publication/docker-security/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Docker Security book&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://binarymist.io/blog/2018/03/31/docker-security/#the-default-user-is-root&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drive a &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;least privilege policy&lt;/a&gt; around this, configuring a strong &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#configure-strong-password-policy&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;password policy&lt;/a&gt; for your users, and implement &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/iam/details/mfa/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;multi-factor authentication&lt;/a&gt;, which will help with poor password selection. I discuss this in more depth in the &lt;a href=&#34;#cloud-countermeasures-storage-of-secrets&#34;&gt;Storage of Secrets&lt;/a&gt; subsection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;cloud-countermeasures-violations-of-least-privilege-csp-account-single-user-root&#34;&gt;CSP Account Single User Root&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I discuss in the &lt;a href=&#34;#cloud-countermeasures-storage-of-secrets-credentials-and-other-secrets&#34;&gt;Credentials and Other Secrets&lt;/a&gt; Countermeasures subsection of this chapter, create multiple accounts with least privileges required for each; the root user should hardly ever be used. Create groups and attach restricted policies to them, then add the specific users to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also as discussed in the &lt;a href=&#34;#cloud-countermeasures-storage-of-secrets-credentials-and-other-secrets-entered-by-people-manually&#34;&gt;Credentials and Other Secrets&lt;/a&gt; countermeasures subsection, there should be almost no reason to generate key(s) for the AWS Command Line Tools for the AWS account root user. But if you do, consider setting up notifications for when they are used. As usual, AWS has plenty of &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-receive-notifications-when-your-aws-accounts-root-access-keys-are-used/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;
on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another idea is to set-up monitoring and notifications on activity of your AWS account root user. AWS &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/monitor-and-notify-on-aws-account-root-user-activity/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; explains how to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also a collection of monitoring specific items that you should review in the Monitoring subsection of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/compliance/AWS_CIS_Foundations_Benchmark.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CIS AWS Foundations document&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another great idea is to generate an AWS key &lt;a href=&#34;https://canarytokens.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Canarytoken&lt;/a&gt; from canarytokens.org, and put it somewhere more obvious than your real AWS key(s). When someone uses it, you will be automatically notified. I discussed these with Haroon Meer on the Software Engineering Radio &lt;a href=&#34;https://binarymist.io/publication/ser-podcast-network-security/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Network Security&lt;/a&gt; podcast. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/HeyJayza&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Jay&lt;/a&gt; also wrote a &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.thinkst.com/2017/09/canarytokens-new-member-aws-api-key.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; on the thinkst blog on how you can set this up, and what the inner workings look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also consider rotating your IAM access keys for your CSP services. AWS EC2, for example, provides &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-rotate-access-keys-for-iam-users/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;auto-expire, auto-renew&lt;/a&gt; access keys when using roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;cloud-countermeasures-storage-of-secrets-private-key-abuse-ssh&#34;&gt;SSH&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to harden SSH as we discussed in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap03.html#vps-countermeasures-disable-remove-services-harden-what-is-left-ssh&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SSH&lt;/a&gt; subsection of the VPS chapter of Holistic Info-Sec for Web Developers, Fascicle 1. Usually the issue will be specific to lack of knowledge, desire and a dysfunctional &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.binarymist.net/2014/04/26/culture-in-the-work-place/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;culture&lt;/a&gt; in the work place. You will need to address the people issues before looking at basic SSH hardening techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, SSH access should be reduced to a selected few. Most of the work we do now by SSHing should be automated. If you review the commands in history on most VPSs, the majority of the commands are either deployment or monitoring which should all be &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/binarymist/aws-docker-host&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;automated&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you create an AWS EC2 instance you can create a key pair &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html#having-ec2-create-your-key-pair&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;using EC2&lt;/a&gt; or you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html#how-to-generate-your-own-key-and-import-it-to-aws&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;provide your own&lt;/a&gt;. Either way, to be able to log-in to your instance, you need to have provided EC2 with the public key of your key pair and specified it by name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every user should have their &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;own key-pair&lt;/a&gt;, the private part should always be private, kept in the users local &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh/&lt;/code&gt; directory (not the server) with permissions &lt;code&gt;600&lt;/code&gt; or more restrictive, and not shared on your developer wiki, or anywhere else for that matter. The public part can be put on every server that the user needs access to. There is no excuse for users not to have their own key pair, you can have up to five thousand key pairs per AWS region. AWS has &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;clear directions&lt;/a&gt; on how to create additional users and provide SSH access with their own key pairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For generic confirmation of the host&amp;rsquo;s SSH key fingerprint when prompted before establishing the SSH connection, follow the procedure I laid out for &lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap03.html#vps-countermeasures-disable-remove-services-harden-what-is-left-ssh-establishing-your-ssh-servers-key-fingerprint&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Establishing your SSH Servers Key Fingerprint&lt;/a&gt; in the VPS chapter of Holistic Info-Sec for Web Developers, Fascicle 1, and make it organisational policy. We should never blindly accept key fingerprints. The key fingerprints should be stored in a relatively secure place, so that only trusted parties can modify them. I would like to see, as part of the server creation process, the entity (probably the wiki) that specifies the key fingerprints is automatically updated by something on the VPS that keeps watch of the key fingerprints. Something like &lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap03.html#vps-countermeasures-lack-of-visibility-proactive-monitoring-getting-started-with-monit&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Monit&lt;/a&gt;, would be capable of the monitoring and executing a script to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To SSH to an EC2 instance, you will have to view the console output of the keys being generated. You can see this &lt;strong&gt;only for the first run&lt;/strong&gt; of the instance when it is being created, this can be seen by first fetching &lt;a href=&#34;https://console.aws.amazon.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://console.aws.amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;, then:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the &amp;ldquo;EC2&amp;rdquo; link&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click &amp;ldquo;Instances&amp;rdquo; in the left column&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the instance name you want&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the select button &amp;ldquo;Actions&amp;rdquo; and choose &amp;ldquo;Get System Log&amp;rdquo; (a.k.a. &amp;ldquo;Console Output&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the console output, you should see the keys being generated. Record them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, to SSH to your EC2 instance, the command to use can be seen by fetching&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://console.aws.amazon.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://console.aws.amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;, then:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EC2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instances&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select your instance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the Connect button for details&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;cloud-countermeasures-storage-of-secrets-private-key-abuse-tls&#34;&gt;TLS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how do we stop baking secrets into our Docker images?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest way is to avoid adding secrets to the process of building your images. You can add them at run time in several ways. If you have a look at Namespaces in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://binarymist.io/publication/docker-security/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Docker Security book&lt;/a&gt;, also discussed in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://binarymist.io/blog/2018/03/31/docker-security/#namespaces-risks&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Docker Security blog post&lt;/a&gt;, we used volumes. This allows us to keep the secrets entirely out of the image and only include in the container as mounted host directories, rather than adding those secrets to the &lt;code&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&#34;mitigate-private-key-abuse-via-terminal&#34;&gt;Mitigate private key abuse via terminal&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;docker run -d -p &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;443&lt;/span&gt;:443 -v /host-path/star.mydomain.com.cert:/etc/nginx/certs/my.cert -v /host-path/star.mydomain.com.key:/etc/nginx/certs/my.key -e &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;mySecret=dirty little secret&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; nginx&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An even easier technique is to just implement adding of secrets in the &lt;code&gt;docker-compose.yml&lt;/code&gt; file, thus saving time when you run the container:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&#34;mitigate-private-key-abuse-using-docker-compose-yml&#34;&gt;Mitigate private key abuse using docker-compose.yml&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;nginx:
    build: .
    ports:
        - &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;443:443&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
    volumes:
        - /host-path/star.mydomain.com.key:/etc/nginx/ssl/nginx.key
        - /host-path/star.mydomain.com.cert:/etc/nginx/ssl/nginx.crt
        - /host-path/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
    env_file:
        - /host-path/secrets.env&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;code&gt;env_file&lt;/code&gt; we can hide our environment variables in the &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;br /&gt;
Our &lt;code&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/code&gt; would now look like the following, even our config is volume mounted and will no longer reside in our image:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&#34;mitigate-private-key-abuse-using-dockerfile&#34;&gt;Mitigate private key abuse using Dockerfile&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;FROM nginx

&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# ...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;# ...&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;cloud-countermeasures-storage-of-secrets-credentials-and-other-secrets-entered-by-people-manually&#34;&gt;Entered by People (manually)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protecting against outsiders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most effective alternative to storing user-names and passwords in an insecure manner is to use a group or team password manager. There are quite a few offerings available with all sorts of different attributes. The following are some of the points you will need to consider as part of your selection process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cost in terms of money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cost in terms of set-up and maintenance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Closed or open source. If you care about security, which you must if you are considering a team password manager, it is important to see how secrets are handled. I need to be able to see how the code is written, and which &lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap06.html#web-applications-countermeasures-data-store-compromise-which-kdf-to-use&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Key Derivation Functions&lt;/a&gt; (KDFs) and &lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap06.html#web-applications-identify-risks-cryptography-on-the-client&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;cyphers&lt;/a&gt; are used. If it is of high quality, we can have more confidence that our precious sensitive pieces of information are, in fact, going to be private&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you need a web client?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you need a mobile client (iOS, Android)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What platforms does it need to support?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does it need to be able to manage secrets of multiple customers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Auditing of user actions? Who is accessing and changing what?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to be able to lock out users, when they leave the organisation, for example?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multi-factor authentication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Options: Does it have all the features you need?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who is behind the offering? Are they well known for creating solid, reliable, secure solutions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following are my personal top three, with the first being my preference, based on research I performed for one of my customers recently. All the points above were considered for a collection of about ten team password managers that I reviewed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://pleasantsolutions.com/PasswordServer/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Pleasant Password Server&lt;/a&gt; (KeePass backed)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.manageengine.com/products/passwordmanagerpro/msp/features.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Password Manager Pro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lastpass.com/teams&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;LastPass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protecting against insiders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above alone is not going to stop an account take over if you are sharing the likes of the AWS account root user email and password, even if it is in a group password manager. As AWS has &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/getting-started_create-admin-group.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;already stated&lt;/a&gt;, only use the root user for what is absolutely essential (remember: least privilege). This is usually just to create an Administrators group to which you attach the &lt;code&gt;AdministratorAccess&lt;/code&gt; managed policy, then add any new IAM users to that group who require administrative access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have created IAM users within an Administrators group as mentioned above, these users should set up groups to which you attach further restricted managed policies such as a group for &lt;code&gt;PowerUserAccess&lt;/code&gt;, a group for &lt;code&gt;ReadOnlyAccess&lt;/code&gt;, a group for &lt;code&gt;IAMFullAccess&lt;/code&gt;, progressively becoming more restrictive. Use the most restrictive group possible in order to achieve specific tasks, simply assigning users to the groups you have created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be sure to use multi-factor authentication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your AWS users are not assigned access keys to use for programmatic access by default, do not create these unless you actually need them, and again consider least privilege. There should be almost no reason to create an &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#lock-away-credentials&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;access key&lt;/a&gt; for the root user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Configure &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#configure-strong-password-policy&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;strong password policies&lt;/a&gt; for your users, make sure they are using personal password managers and know how to generate long complex passwords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;cloud-countermeasures-storage-of-secrets-credentials-and-other-secrets-entered-by-software&#34;&gt;Entered by Software (automatically)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many places in software that require access to secrets, to communicate with services, APIs, datastores. Configuration and infrastructure management systems have a problem storing and accessing these secrets in a secure manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HashiCorp &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vaultproject.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Vault&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. The most fully featured of these tools, has the following attributes/features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hashicorp/vault&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Open Source&lt;/a&gt; written in Go-Lang&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deployable to any environment, including development machines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arbitrary key/value secrets can be stored of any type of data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports cryptographic operations of the secrets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports dynamic secrets, generating credentials on-demand for fine-grained security controls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Auditing: Vault forces a mandatory lease contract with clients, which allows the rolling of keys, automatic revocation, along with multiple revocation mechanisms providing operators a break-glass for security incidents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-repudiation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secrets protected in transit and at rest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not coupled to any specific configuration or infrastructure management system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can read secrets from configuration, infrastructure management systems and applications via its API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applications can query Vault for secrets to connect to services such as datastores, thus removing the need for these secrets to reside in configuration files (See the &lt;a href=&#34;#cloud-risks-that-solution-causes-storage-of-secrets-credentials-and-other-secrets-entered-by-software&#34;&gt;Risks that Solution Causes&lt;/a&gt; for the caveat)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requires multiple keys generally distributed to multiple individuals to read its encrypted secrets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Secret Backends&lt;/a&gt; for integrations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manages any sensitive data (including generic string or binary content up to 500 kb in size) that a &lt;a href=&#34;#cloud-countermeasures-storage-of-secrets-private-key-abuse-tls&#34;&gt;container needs at runtime&lt;/a&gt;, but you do not want to &lt;a href=&#34;#cloud-identify-risks-storage-of-secrets-private-key-abuse-tls&#34;&gt;store in the image&lt;/a&gt;, source control, or the host systems file-system as we did in the TLS section above&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only available to Docker containers managed by Swarm (services). Swarm manages the secrets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secrets are stored in the Raft log, which is encrypted if using Docker 1.13 and higher&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any given secret is only accessibly to services (Swarm managed container) that have been granted explicit access to the secret&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secrets are decrypted and mounted into the container in an in-memory filesystem which defaults to &lt;code&gt;/run/secrets/&amp;lt;secret_name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in Linux, &lt;code&gt;C:\ProgramData\Docker\secrets&lt;/code&gt; in Windows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ansible is an &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/docs/docsite/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Open Source&lt;/a&gt; configuration management tool, and has a simple secrets management feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ansible tasks and handlers can be encrypted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arbitrary files, including binary data can be encrypted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From version 2.3 can encrypt single values inside YAML files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suggested workflow is to check the encrypted files into source control for auditing purposes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Centralised store on AWS to manage configuration data, plain text, or encrypted secrets via AWS KMS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All calls to the parameter store are recorded with AWS CloudTrail, supports access controls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Netflix/security_monkey/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Security Monkey&lt;/a&gt;: Monitors AWS and GCP accounts for policy changes, and alerts on insecure configurations, conceptually similar to AWS Config, as discussed in the &lt;a href=&#34;#cloud-countermeasures-violations-of-least-privilege&#34;&gt;Violations of Least Privilege&lt;/a&gt; countermeasures subsection. Security Monkey is free and open source. Although not strictly security related, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Netflix/SimianArmy/wiki&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Simian Army&lt;/a&gt; tools from Netflix are also well worth mentioning if you are serious about doing things the right way in AWS. They include:

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloudsploit.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CloudSploit&lt;/a&gt;: Aims to solve the problem of misconfigured AWS accounts with background scanning through hundreds of resources, settings, and activity logs looking for potential issues. Their blog also has some good resources on it. Scan reports include in-depth remediation steps. Has a free and paid hosted tiers. Auto scanning scheduling for the paid plans. Is open source on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cloudsploit/scans&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;cloud-costs-and-trade-offs-violations-of-least-privilege&#34;&gt;Violations of Least Privilege&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth investing the effort to make sure only the required user permissions are granted. As discussed, there are tools you can use to help speed this process up and make it more accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Running services as root&lt;/strong&gt;: Always start with the minimum permissions possible and add if necessary, it is far easier to add than to remove&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Configuration Settings Changed Ad Hoc&lt;/strong&gt;: Remember detection works where prevention fails. Where your change control fails, because it is decided not to use it, you need something to detect changes and notify someone who cares. For this, there are also other options specifically designed to perform this function. For a collection of such tools, review the &lt;a href=&#34;#cloud-countermeasures-aws-additional-tooling&#34;&gt;Tooling&lt;/a&gt; sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to have these tools set up so that they are &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.cloudsploit.com/the-importance-of-continual-auditing-in-the-cloud-8d22e0554639&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;continually auditing&lt;/a&gt; your infrastructure and notifying the person(s) responsible for issues resolution, rather than having people continually manually reviewing settings, permissions, and so forth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Machine Instance Access To Open&lt;/strong&gt;: Set-up a bastion host and lock the source IP address down to the public facing IP address of your bastion host required to access your machine instances. I discussed locking the source IP address down in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap03.html#vps-countermeasures-disable-remove-services-harden-what-is-left-ssh&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hardening SSH subsection&lt;/a&gt; of the VPS chapter of Holistic Info-Sec for Web Developers, Fascicle 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your bastion host will be hardened as discussed throughout the VPS chapter. All authorised workers can VPN to the bastion host and SSH from there, or just SSH tunnel from wherever they are through the bastion host via port forwarding to any given machine instances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have Windows boxes you need to reach, you can tunnel RDP through your SSH tunnel, see my &lt;a href=&#34;https://binarymist.io/blog/2010/08/26/installation-of-ssh-on-64bit-windows-7-to-tunnel-rdp/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;blog post about this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than tunnelling, another option SSH gives us (using the &lt;code&gt;-A&lt;/code&gt; option) is to hop from the bastion host to your machine instances by forwarding the private key. This does include the risk that someone could gain access to your forwarded SSH agent connection, thus being able to use your private key while you have an SSH connection established. &lt;code&gt;ssh-add -c&lt;/code&gt; can provide some protection with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do decide to use the &lt;code&gt;-A&lt;/code&gt; option, then you are essentially considering your bastion host as a trusted machine. I commented on the &lt;code&gt;-A&lt;/code&gt; option in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap03.html#vps-countermeasures-disable-remove-services-harden-what-is-left-ssh-tunneling-ssh&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Tunnelling SSH&lt;/a&gt; subsection of the VPS chapter of Holistic Info-Sec for Web Developers, Fascicle 1. There is plenty of good &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloudacademy.com/blog/aws-bastion-host-nat-instances-vpc-peering-security/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; on setting up the bastion host in AWS. AWS provides some &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quickstart/latest/linux-bastion/architecture.html#best-practices&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Best Practices&lt;/a&gt; for security on bastion hosts, and also &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-record-ssh-sessions-established-through-a-bastion-host/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;discusses&lt;/a&gt; recording the SSH sessions that your users establish through a bastion host for auditing purposes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re invested in the Cloud, and let&amp;rsquo;s face it, who isn&amp;rsquo;t now days, this book will provide visibility into what you may currently be doing wrong and how to secure your Cloud environments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;If you are a Software Developer/DevOps Engineer working with Docker, and are one of those types that take their profession seriously (hint: most people that call themselves Engineers do), believe that if a job is worth doing, it&amp;rsquo;s worth doing well, take quality, good design, and security seriously, then I may have just the book you&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for. 😌&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently released a book on &lt;a href=&#34;https://binarymist.io/tags/docker/&#34;&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt; Security, which addresses many of the concerns with the default level of security around Docker and Docker deployments. The book is purposed to help Software Developers/DevOps Engineers address these concerns quickly. The following is a snapshot of what&amp;rsquo;s included in the book:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://binarymist.io/publication/docker-security/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://binarymist.io/img/publication/title_page_docker-security_720.png&#34; alt=&#34;Docker Security Quick Reference&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is worse, Docker&amp;rsquo;s default is to run containers, and all commands / processes within a container as root. This can be seen by running the following command from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://benchmarks.cisecurity.org/tools2/docker/CIS_Docker_1.13.0_Benchmark_v1.0.0.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CIS_Docker_1.13.0_Benchmark&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;docker ps --quiet | xargs docker inspect --format &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;{{ .Id }}: User={{ .Config.User }}&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have two containers running, and the user has not been specified, you will see something like the below, which means your two containers are running as root.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&#34;result-of-user-running-containers-output&#34;&gt;Result of user running containers output&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;container n Id&amp;gt;: User&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;
&amp;lt;container n+1 Id&amp;gt;: User&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Images derived from other images inherit the same user defined in the parent image explicitly or implicitly, so unless the image creator has specifically defined a non-root user, the user will default to root. That means all processes within the container will run as root.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://binarymist.io/img/post/2018/04/PreventionVERYEASY.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to run containers as a non-root user, the user needs to be added in the base image (&lt;code&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/code&gt;) if it is under your control, and set before any commands you want run as a non-root user. Here is an example of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/owasp/nodegoat&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;NodeGoat&lt;/a&gt; image:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see on line 4 we create our &lt;code&gt;nodegoat_docker&lt;/code&gt; user.&lt;br /&gt;
On line 8 we add our non-root user to the image with no ability to login.&lt;br /&gt;
On line 15 we change the ownership of the &lt;code&gt;$workdir&lt;/code&gt; so our non-root user has access to do the things that we normally have permissions to do without root, such as installing npm packages and copying files, as we see on line 20 and 21. But first we need to switch to our non-root user on line 18. On lines 25 and 26 we need to reapply ownership and permissions due to the fact that docker does not &lt;code&gt;COPY&lt;/code&gt; according to the user you are set to run commands as.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without reapplying the ownership and permissions of the non-root user as seen above on lines 25 and 26, the container directory listings would look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&#34;no-reapplication-of-ownership-and-permissions&#34;&gt;No reapplication of ownership and permissions&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An alternative to setting the non-root user in the &lt;code&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/code&gt; is to set it in the &lt;code&gt;docker-compose.yml&lt;/code&gt;, provided that the non-root user has been added to the image in the &lt;code&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/code&gt;. In the case of NodeGoat, the mongo &lt;code&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/code&gt; is maintained by DockerHub, and it adds a user called &lt;code&gt;mongodb&lt;/code&gt;. In the NodeGoat projects &lt;code&gt;docker-compose.yml&lt;/code&gt;, we just need to set the user, as seen on line 13 below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&#34;nodegoat-docker-compose.yml&#34;&gt;NodeGoat docker-compose.yml&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, a container may be run as a non-root user by running the following command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;docker run -it --user lowprivuser myimage&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but this is not ideal, the specific user should usually be part of the build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://binarymist.io/img/post/2018/04/difficult-uncommon-average-moderate.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering that these processes run as root, and have &lt;a href=&#34;https://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.co.nz/2012/09/how-is-qubes-os-different-from.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;indirect access&lt;/a&gt; to most of the Linux Kernel (20+ million lines of code written by humans) APIs, such as networking, USB, storage stacks, and others via System calls, the situation may look bleak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://binarymist.io/img/post/2018/04/HypervisorVsContainers.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/syscalls.2.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;System calls&lt;/a&gt; are how programmes access the kernel to perform tasks. This attack surface is huge, and all before any security is added on top in the form of LXC, libcontainer (now &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/opencontainers/runc&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;opencontainers/runc&lt;/a&gt;), or &lt;a href=&#34;#docker-host-engine-and-containers-linux-security-modules-risks&#34;&gt;Linux Security Modules (LSM)&lt;/a&gt; such as AppArmor or SELinux. These are often seen as an annoyance and just disabled like many other forms of security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you run a container, you may have to install &lt;code&gt;kmod&lt;/code&gt;, then run &lt;code&gt;lsmod&lt;/code&gt; in the container, and also on the host system. You will see that the same modules are loaded, this is because as mentioned, the container shares the host kernel, so there is not a lot between processes within the container and the host kernel. As mentioned above, the processes within the container may be running as root as well, it pays for you to have a good understanding of the security features Docker provides, and how to employ them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;#docker-engine-and-containers-seccomp-risks&#34;&gt;Seccomp section below&lt;/a&gt; discusses Docker&amp;rsquo;s attempt to put a stop to some System calls accessing the kernel APIs. There are also many other features that Docker has added or leveraged in terms of mitigating a lot of this potential abuse. Although the situation initially looks bad, Docker has done a lot to improve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see in the above image, the host kernel is open to receiving potential abuse from containers. Make sure you keep it patched. We will now walk though many areas of potential abuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://binarymist.io/img/post/2018/04/PreventionDIFFICULT.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure you keep your host kernel well patched, as it is a huge attack surface, with all of your containers accessing it via System calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The space for tooling to help find vulnerabilities in code, packages, etc within your Docker images has been noted, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://community.alfresco.com/community/ecm/blog/2015/12/03/docker-security-tools-audit-and-vulnerability-assessment/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;tools provided&lt;/a&gt;. The following is a sorted list of what feels like does the least and is the simplest in terms of security/hardening features to what does the most, not understating tools that do a little, but do it well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These tools should form a part of your secure and trusted build pipeline, or &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.acolyer.org/2017/04/03/a-study-of-security-vulnerabilities-on-docker-hub/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;software supply-chain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;twistLock&#34;&gt;TwistLock&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TwistLock is a fairly comprehensive and complete proprietary offering with a free developer edition. The following details were taken from TwistLock marketing pages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;namespaces-risks&#34;&gt;Namespaces (Risks)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first place to read for solid background on Linux kernel namespaces is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/namespaces.7.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;man-page&lt;/a&gt;, otherwise I&amp;rsquo;d just be repeating what is there. A lot of what follows about namespaces requires some knowledge from the namespaces man-page, so do yourself a favour and read it first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linux kernel namespaces were first added between 2.6.15 (January 2006) and 2.6.26 (July 2008).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the namespaces man page, IPC, network and UTS namespace support was available from kernel version 3.0, while mount, PID and user namespace support was available from kernel version 3.8 (February 2013), and cgroup namespace support was available from kernel version 4.6 (May 2016).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each aspect of a container runs in a separate namespace and its access is limited to that namespace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Docker leverages the Linux (kernel) namespaces which provide an isolated workspace wrapped with a global system resource abstraction. This makes it appear to the processes within the namespace that they have their own isolated instance of the global resource. When a container is run, Docker creates a set of namespaces for that container, providing a layer of isolation between containers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;mnt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: (Mount) Provides filesystem isolation by managing filesystems and mount points. The &lt;code&gt;mnt&lt;/code&gt; namespace allows a container to have its own isolated set of mounted filesystems, the propagation modes can be one of the following: [&lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt;]&lt;code&gt;shared&lt;/code&gt;, [&lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt;]&lt;code&gt;slave&lt;/code&gt; or [&lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt;]&lt;code&gt;private&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; means recursive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you run the following command, then the host&amp;rsquo;s mounted &lt;code&gt;host-path&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/volumes/volumes/#create-and-manage-volumes&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;shared&lt;/a&gt; with all others that mount &lt;code&gt;host-path&lt;/code&gt;. Any changes made to the mounted data will be propagated to those that use the &lt;code&gt;shared&lt;/code&gt; mode propagation. Using &lt;code&gt;slave&lt;/code&gt; means only the master (&lt;code&gt;host-path&lt;/code&gt;) is able to propagate changes, not vice-versa. Using &lt;code&gt;private&lt;/code&gt; which is the default, will ensure no changes can be propagated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&#34;mounting-volumes-in-shared-mode-propagation&#34;&gt;Mounting volumes in shared mode propagation&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;docker run &amp;lt;run arguments&amp;gt; --volume&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=[&lt;/span&gt;host-path:&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;container-path&amp;gt;:&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;z&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;r&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;shared &amp;lt;container image name or id&amp;gt; &amp;lt;command&amp;gt; &amp;lt;args...&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you omit the &lt;code&gt;host-path&lt;/code&gt; you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/#locating-a-volume&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;see the host path&lt;/a&gt; that was mounted when running the following command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&#34;query&#34;&gt;Query&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;docker inspect &amp;lt;name or id of container&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find the &amp;ldquo;Mounts&amp;rdquo; property in the JSON produced. It will have a &amp;ldquo;Source&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Destination&amp;rdquo; similar to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&#34;result&#34;&gt;Result&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;...
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Mounts&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Name&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&amp;lt;container id&amp;gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Source&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;/var/lib/docker/volumes/&amp;lt;container id&amp;gt;/_data&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Destination&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&amp;lt;container-path&amp;gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Mode&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;RW&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: true,
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Propagation&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;shared&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
...&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An empty string for Mode means that it is set to its read-write default. For example, a container can mount sensitive host system directories such as &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/boot&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/etc&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/lib&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/proc&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/sys&lt;/code&gt;, along with the rest as I discuss in the Lock Down the Mounting of Partitions section of my book &lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Fascicle 1 of Holistic Info-Sec for Web Developers&lt;/a&gt;, particularly if that advice is not followed. If it is followed, you have some defence in depth working for you, and although Docker may have mounted a directory as read-write, the underlying mount may be read-only, thus stopping the container from being able to modify files in these locations on the host system. If the host does not have the above directories mounted with constrained permissions, then we are relying on the user running any given Docker container that mounts a sensitive host volume to mount it as read-only. For example, after the following command has been run, users within the container can modify files in the hosts &lt;code&gt;/etc&lt;/code&gt; directory:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Type&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;bind&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Source&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;/etc&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Destination&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;/hosts-etc&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Mode&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;RW&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;:true,
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Propagation&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also keep in mind that, by default, the user in the container, unless otherwise specified, is root, the same root user as on the host system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div id=&#34;docker-host-engine-and-containers-namespaces-mnt-labelling&#34;/&gt;
Labelling systems such as &lt;a href=&#34;#docker-host-engine-and-containers-linux-security-modules-risks&#34;&gt;Linux Security Modules (LSM)&lt;/a&gt; require that the contents of a volume mounted into a container be &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/volumes/volumes/#create-and-manage-volumes&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;labelled&lt;/a&gt;. This can be done by adding the &lt;code&gt;z&lt;/code&gt; (as seen in above example) or &lt;code&gt;Z&lt;/code&gt; suffix to the volume mount. The &lt;code&gt;z&lt;/code&gt; suffix instructs Docker to share the mounted volume with other containers, and in so doing, Docker applies a shared content label. Alternatively, if you provide the &lt;code&gt;Z&lt;/code&gt; suffix, Docker applies a private unshared label, which means only the current container can use the mounted volume. Further details can be found at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/volumes/volumes/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;dockervolumes documentation&lt;/a&gt;. This is something to keep in mind if you are using LSM, and have a process inside your container that is unable to use the mounted data.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;--volumes-from&lt;/code&gt; allows you to specify a data volume from another container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also &lt;a href=&#34;https://linux.die.net/man/8/mount&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;mount&lt;/a&gt; your Docker container mounts on the host by doing the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;mount --bind /var/lib/docker/&amp;lt;volumes&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;container id&amp;gt;/_data &amp;lt;/path/on/host&amp;gt;
    &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;PID&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: (Process ID) Provides process isolation, separates container processes from host and other container processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first process that is created in a new &lt;code&gt;PID&lt;/code&gt; namespace is the &amp;ldquo;init&amp;rdquo; process with &lt;code&gt;PID&lt;/code&gt; 1, which assumes parenthood of the other processes within the same &lt;code&gt;PID&lt;/code&gt; namespace. When &lt;code&gt;PID&lt;/code&gt; 1 is terminated, so are the rest of the processes within the same &lt;code&gt;PID&lt;/code&gt; namespace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;PID&lt;/code&gt; namespaces are &lt;a href=&#34;https://lwn.net/Articles/531419/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;hierarchically nested&lt;/a&gt; in ancestor-descendant relationships to a depth of up to 32 levels. All &lt;code&gt;PID&lt;/code&gt; namespaces have a parent namespace, other than the initial root &lt;code&gt;PID&lt;/code&gt; namespace of the host system. That parent namespace is the &lt;code&gt;PID&lt;/code&gt; namespace of the process that created the child namespace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within a &lt;code&gt;PID&lt;/code&gt; namespace, it is possible to access (make system calls to specific &lt;code&gt;PID&lt;/code&gt;s) all other processes in the same namespace, as well as all processes of descendant namespaces. However, processes in a child &lt;code&gt;PID&lt;/code&gt; namespace cannot see processes that exist in the parent &lt;code&gt;PID&lt;/code&gt; namespace or further removed ancestor namespaces. The direction any process can access another process in an ancestor/descendant &lt;code&gt;PID&lt;/code&gt; namespace is one way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Processes in different &lt;code&gt;PID&lt;/code&gt; namespaces can have the same &lt;code&gt;PID&lt;/code&gt;, because the &lt;code&gt;PID&lt;/code&gt; namespace isolates the &lt;code&gt;PID&lt;/code&gt; number space from other &lt;code&gt;PID&lt;/code&gt; namespaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Docker takes advantage of &lt;code&gt;PID&lt;/code&gt; namespaces. Just as you would expect, a Docker container can not access the host system processes, and process Ids that are used in the host system can be reused in the container, including &lt;code&gt;PID&lt;/code&gt; 1, by being reassigned to a process started within the container. The host system can however access all processes within its containers, because as stated above, &lt;code&gt;PID&lt;/code&gt; namespaces are hierarchically nested in parent-child relationships. Processes in the hosts &lt;code&gt;PID&lt;/code&gt; namespace can access all processes in their own namespace down to the &lt;code&gt;PID&lt;/code&gt; namespace that was responsible for starting the process, such as the process within the container in our case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The default behaviour can however be overridden to allow a container to be able to access processes within a sibling container, or the hosts &lt;code&gt;PID&lt;/code&gt; namespace. &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#pid-settings-pid&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Example&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;docker import &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;OPTIONS&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; file|URL|- &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;REPOSITORY&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;:TAG&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;
docker container unpause myContainer &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;mySecondContainer...&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;net&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: (Networking) Provides network isolation by managing the network stack and interfaces. It&amp;rsquo;s also essential to allow containers to communicate with the host system and other containers. Network namespaces were introduced into the kernel in 2.6.24, January 2008, with an additional year of development they were considered largely done. The only real concern here is understanding the Docker network modes and communication between containers. This is discussed in the Countermeasures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;UTS&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: (Unix Timesharing System) Provides isolation of kernel and version identifiers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UTS is the sharing of a computing resource with many users, a concept introduced in the 1960s/1970s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A UTS namespace is the set of identifiers &lt;a href=&#34;http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;returned by &lt;code&gt;uname&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which include the hostname and the NIS domain name. Any processes which are not children of the process that requested the clone will not be able to see any changes made to the identifiers of the UTS namespace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the &lt;code&gt;CLONE_NEWUTS&lt;/code&gt; constant is set, then the process being created will be created in a new UTS namespace with the hostname and NIS domain name copied and able to be modified independently from the UTS namespace of the calling process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the &lt;code&gt;CLONE_NEWUTS&lt;/code&gt; constant is not set, then the process being created will be created in the same UTS namespace of the calling process, thus able to change the identifiers returned by &lt;code&gt;uname&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a container is created, a UTS namespace is copied (&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/docker/libcontainer/blob/83a102cc68a09d890cce3b6c2e5c14c49e6373a0/SPEC.md&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;CLONE_NEWUTS&lt;/code&gt; is set&lt;/a&gt;)(&lt;code&gt;--uts=&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;) by default, providing a UTS namespace that can be modified independently from the target UTS namespece it was copied from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a container is created with &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#uts-settings-uts&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;--uts=&amp;quot;host&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a UTS namespace is inherited from the host, the &lt;code&gt;--hostname&lt;/code&gt; flag is invalid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;IPC&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: (InterProcess Communication) manages access to InterProcess Communications). &lt;code&gt;IPC&lt;/code&gt; namespaces isolate your container&amp;rsquo;s System V IPC and POSIX message queues, semaphores, and named shared memory from those of the host and other containers, unless another container specifies on run that it wants to share your namespace. It would be a lot safer if the producer could specify which consuming containers could use its &lt;a href=&#34;http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/namespaces.7.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;namespace&lt;/a&gt;. IPC namespaces do not include IPC mechanisms that use filesystem resources such as named pipes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/namespaces.7.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;namespaces man page&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Objects created in an IPC namespace are visible to all other processes that are members of that namespace, but are not visible to processes in other IPC namespaces.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although sharing memory segments between processes provide Inter-Process Communications at memory speed, rather than through pipes or worse, the network stack, this produces a significant security concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By default a container does not share the host&amp;rsquo;s or any other container&amp;rsquo;s IPC namespace. This behaviour can be overridden to allow a (any) container to reuse another container&amp;rsquo;s or the host&amp;rsquo;s message queues, semaphores, and shared memory via their IPC namespace. &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#ipc-settings-ipc&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Example&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&#34;syntax-1&#34;&gt;Syntax&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# Allows a container to reuse another container&amp;#39;s IPC namespace.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;--ipc&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=[&lt;/span&gt;container:&amp;lt;name|id&amp;gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;host&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&#34;example-3&#34;&gt;Example&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;docker run -it --rm --name&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;container-producer ubuntu
root@609d19340303:/#

&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# Allows the container named container-consumer to share the IPC namespace
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# of container called container-producer.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;docker run -it --rm --name&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;container-consumer --ipc&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;container:container-producer ubuntu
root@d68ecd6ce69b:/#&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now find the Ids of the two running containers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&#34;query-2&#34;&gt;Query&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;docker inspect --format&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;{{ .Id }}&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; container-producer container-consumer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&#34;result-2&#34;&gt;Result&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;609d193403032a49481099b1fc53037fb5352ae148c58c362ab0a020f473c040
d68ecd6ce69b89253f7ab14de23c9335acaca64d210280590731ce1fcf7a7556&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see from using the command supplied by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://benchmarks.cisecurity.org/tools2/docker/CIS_Docker_1.13.0_Benchmark_v1.0.0.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CIS_Docker_1.13.0_Benchmark&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;code&gt;container-consumer&lt;/code&gt; is using the IPC namespace of &lt;code&gt;container-producer&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&#34;query-3&#34;&gt;Query&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;docker ps --quiet --all | xargs docker inspect --format &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;{{ .Id }}: IpcMode={{ .HostConfig.IpcMode }}&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&#34;result-3&#34;&gt;Result&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;d68ecd6ce69b89253f7ab14de23c9335acaca64d210280590731ce1fcf7a7556: IpcMode&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;container:container-producer
609d193403032a49481099b1fc53037fb5352ae148c58c362ab0a020f473c040: IpcMode&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the last process in an IPC namespace terminates, the namespace will be destroyed along with all IPC objects in the namespace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;user&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Not enabled by default. Allows a process within a container to have a unique range of user and group Ids within the container, known as the subordinate user and group Id feature in the Linux kernel. These do not map to the same user and group Ids of the host, container users to host users are remapped. For example, if a user within a container is root, which it is by default unless a specific user is defined in the image hierarchy, it will be mapped to a non-privileged user on the host system.&lt;br /&gt;
Docker considers user namespaces to be an advanced feature. There are currently some Docker features that are &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/#daemon-user-namespace-options&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;incompatible&lt;/a&gt; with using user namespaces, and according to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://benchmarks.cisecurity.org/tools2/docker/CIS_Docker_1.13.0_Benchmark_v1.0.0.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CIS Docker 1.13.0 Benchmark&lt;/a&gt;, functionalities that are broken if user namespaces are used. the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/#daemon-user-namespace-options&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Docker engine reference&lt;/a&gt; provides additional details around known restrictions of user namespaces.&lt;br /&gt;
If your containers have a predefined non-root user, then, currently, user namespaces should not be enabled, due to possible unpredictable issues and complexities, according to &amp;ldquo;2.8 Enable user namespace support&amp;rdquo; of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://benchmarks.cisecurity.org/tools2/docker/CIS_Docker_1.13.0_Benchmark_v1.0.0.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CIS Docker Benchmark&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
The problem is that these mappings are performed on the Docker daemon rather than at a per-container level, so it is an all or nothing approach. This may change in the future though.&lt;br /&gt;
As mentioned, user namespace support is available, but not enabled by default in the Docker daemon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;mnt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Keep the default propagation mode of &lt;code&gt;private&lt;/code&gt; unless you have a very good reason to change it. If you do need to change it, think about defence in depth and employ other defence strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have control over the Docker host, lock down the mounting of the host systems partitions as I discussed in the Lock Down the Mounting of Partitions subsection of the VPS chapter of my book &lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Fascicle 1 Holistic Info-Sec for Web Developers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have to mount a sensitive host system directory, mount it as read-only:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;docker run -it --rm -v /etc:/hosts-etc:ro --name&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;lets-mount-etc ubuntu
    &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If any file modifications are now attempted on &lt;code&gt;/etc&lt;/code&gt; they will be unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&#34;query-4&#34;&gt;Query&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;docker inspect -f &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;{{ json .Mounts }}&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; lets-mount-etc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&#34;result-4&#34;&gt;Result&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Type&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;bind&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Source&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;/etc&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Destination&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;/hosts-etc&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Mode&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;ro&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;RW&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;:false,
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Propagation&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, as discussed previously, lock down the user to non-root.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are using LSM, you will probably want to use the &lt;code&gt;Z&lt;/code&gt; option as discussed in the risks section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;PID&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: By default enforces isolation from the containers &lt;code&gt;PID&lt;/code&gt; namespace, but not from the host to the container. If you are concerned about host systems being able to access your containers, as you should be, consider putting your containers within a VM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;net&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: A network namespace is a virtualisation of the network stack, with its own network devices, IP routing tables, firewall rules and ports.&lt;br /&gt;
When a network namespace is created the only network interface that is created is the loopback interface, which is down until brought up.&lt;br /&gt;
Each network interface, whether physical or virtual, can only reside in one namespace, but can be moved between namespaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the last process in a network namespace terminates, the namespace will be destroyed, destroy any virtual interfaces within it, and move any physical network devices back to the initial network namespace, not the process parent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Docker and Network Namespaces&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Docker network is analogous to a Linux kernel network namespace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Docker is installed, three networks are created &lt;code&gt;bridge&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;host&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;, which you can think of as network namespaces. These can be seen by running:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&#34;docker-network-ls-https-docs-docker-com-engine-reference-commandline-network-ls&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/network_ls/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker network ls&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;NETWORK ID    NAME              DRIVER   SCOPE
9897a3063354  bridge            bridge   local
fe179428ccd4  host              host     local
a81e8669bda7  none              null     local
    &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you run a container, if you want to override the default network of &lt;code&gt;bridge&lt;/code&gt;, you can specify which network in which you want to run the container with the &lt;code&gt;--network&lt;/code&gt; flag as the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;docker run --network&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;network&amp;gt;
    &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bridge can be seen by running &lt;code&gt;ifconfig&lt;/code&gt; on the host:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;docker0   Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;05&lt;/span&gt;:22:bb:08:41:b7  
          inet addr:172.17.0.1  Bcast:0.0.0.0  Mask:255.255.0.0
          inet6 addr: fe80::42:fbff:fe80:57a5/64 Scope:Link
    &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the Docker engine (CLI) client or API tells the Docker daemon to run a container, part of the process allocates a bridged interface, unless specified otherwise, that allows processes within the container to communicate to the system host via the virtual Ethernet bridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virtual Ethernet interfaces, when created, are always created as a pair. You can think of them as one interface on each side of a namespace wall with a tube through the wall connecting them. Packets come in one interface and exit the other, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating and Listing Network NameSpaces&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these commands you will need to run as root.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&#34;syntax-2&#34;&gt;Syntax&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;ip netns add &amp;lt;yournamespacename&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&#34;example-4&#34;&gt;Example&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;ip netns add testnamespace&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ip command adds a bind mount point for the &lt;code&gt;testnamespace&lt;/code&gt; namespace to &lt;code&gt;/var/run/netns/&lt;/code&gt;. When the &lt;code&gt;testnamespace&lt;/code&gt; namespace is created, the resulting file descriptor keeps the network namespace alive and persisted. This allows system administrators to apply configuration to the network namespace without fear that it will disappear when no processes are within it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&#34;verify-it-was-added&#34;&gt;Verify it was added&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;ip netns list&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&#34;result-5&#34;&gt;Result&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;testnamespace&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, a network namespace added in this way cannot be used for a Docker container. In order to create a &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Docker network&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;code&gt;kimsdockernet&lt;/code&gt; run the following command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# bridge is the default driver, so not required to be specified
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;docker network create --driver bridge kimsdockernet
    &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can then follow this with a&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;docker network ls&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
to confirm that the network was added. You can base your network on one of the existing &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#network-settings&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;network drivers&lt;/a&gt; created by Docker, the bridge driver is used by default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#network-bridge&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;bridge&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: As seen above with the &lt;code&gt;ifconfig&lt;/code&gt; listing on the host system, an interface is created called docker0 when Docker is installed. A pair of veth (Virtual Ethernet) interfaces are created when the container is run with this &lt;code&gt;--network&lt;/code&gt; option. The &lt;code&gt;veth&lt;/code&gt; on the outside of the container will be attached to the bridge, the other &lt;code&gt;veth&lt;/code&gt; is put inside the container&amp;rsquo;s namespace, along with the existing loopback interface.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#network-none&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;none&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: There will be no networking in the container other than the loopback interface which was created when the network namespace was created, and has no routes to external traffic.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#network-host&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;host&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Uses the network stack that the host system uses inside the container. The &lt;code&gt;host&lt;/code&gt; mode is more performant than the &lt;code&gt;bridge&lt;/code&gt; mode due to using the hosts native network stack, but also less secure.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#network-container&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;container&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Allows you to specify another container to use its network stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When running: &lt;code&gt;docker network inspect kimsdockernet&lt;/code&gt; before starting the container, and then again after, you will see the new container added to the &lt;code&gt;kimsdockernet&lt;/code&gt; network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can run your container using your new network:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;docker run -it --network kimsdockernet --rm --name&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;container0 ubuntu
    &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When one or more processes, Docker containers in this case, uses the &lt;code&gt;kimsdockernet&lt;/code&gt; network, it can also be seen opened by the presence of its file descriptor at:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;/var/run/docker/netns/&amp;lt;filedescriptor&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also see that the container named &lt;code&gt;container0&lt;/code&gt; has a network namespace by running the following command, which shows the file handles for the namespaces, and not just the network namespace:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&#34;query-namespaces&#34;&gt;Query Namespaces&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;sudo ls /proc/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;docker inspect -f &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;{{ .State.Pid }}&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; container0&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;/ns -liah
    &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&#34;result-6&#34;&gt;Result&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;total &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you run&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;ip netns list&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
again, you may think that you should be able to see the Docker network, but you will not, unless you create the following symlink:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;ln -s /proc/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;docker inspect -f &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;{{.State.Pid}}&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; container0&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;/ns/net /var/run/netns/container0
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# Don&amp;#39;t forget to remove the symlink once the container terminates,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# else it will be dangling.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to run a command inside of the Docker network of a container, you can use the &lt;a href=&#34;http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/nsenter.1.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;nsenter&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; command of the &lt;code&gt;util-linux&lt;/code&gt; package:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# Show the ethernet state:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;nsenter -t &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;docker inspect -f &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;{{ .State.Pid }}&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; container0&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt; -n ifconfig
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# Or
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;nsenter -t &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;docker inspect -f &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;{{ .State.Pid }}&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; container0&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt; -n ip addr show
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# Or
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;nsenter --net&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;/var/run/docker/netns/&amp;lt;filedescriptor&amp;gt; ifconfig
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# Or
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;nsenter --net&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;/var/run/docker/netns/&amp;lt;filedescriptor&amp;gt; ip addr show
    &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deleting Network NameSpaces&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following command will remove the bind mount for the specified namespace. The namespace will continue to persist until all processes within it are terminated, at which point any virtual interfaces within it will be destroyed and any physical network devices if they were assigned, would be moved back to the initial network namespace, not the process parent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&#34;syntax-3&#34;&gt;Syntax&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;ip netns delete &amp;lt;yournamespacename&amp;gt;
    &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&#34;example-5&#34;&gt;Example&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;ip netns delete testnamespace
    &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&#34;to-remove-a-docker-network&#34;&gt;To remove a docker network&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;docker network rm kimsdockernet
    &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you still have a container running, you will receive an error:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Error response from daemon: network kimsdockernet has active endpoints&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Stop your container and try again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also pays to &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/default_network/container-communication/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;understand container communication&lt;/a&gt; with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also checkout the &lt;a href=&#34;#additional-resources&#34;&gt;Additional Resources&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;UTS&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Do not start your containers with the &lt;code&gt;--uts&lt;/code&gt; flag set to &lt;code&gt;host&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As mentioned in the CIS_Docker_1.13.0_Benchmark &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Sharing the UTS namespace with the host provides full permission to the container to change the hostname of the host. This is insecure and should not be allowed.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;. You can test that the container is not sharing the host&amp;rsquo;s UTS namespace by making sure that the following command returns nothing, instead of &lt;code&gt;host&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;docker ps --quiet --all | xargs docker inspect --format &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;{{ .Id }}: UTSMode={{ .HostConfig.UTSMode }}&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;IPC&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: In order to stop another untrusted container sharing your containers IPC namespace, you could isolate all of your trusted containers in a VM, or if you are using some type of orchestration, that will usually have functionality to isolate groups of containers. If you can isolate your trusted containers sufficiently, then you may still be able to share the IPC namespace of other near by containers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;user&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: If you have read the &lt;a href=&#34;#docker-host-engine-and-containers-namespaces-risks&#34;&gt;risks section&lt;/a&gt; and still want to enable support for user namespaces, you first need to confirm that the host user of the associated containers &lt;code&gt;PID&lt;/code&gt; is not root by running the following CIS Docker Benchmark recommended commands:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;ps -p &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;docker inspect --format&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;{{ .State.Pid }}&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt;CONTAINER ID&amp;gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; -o pid,user
    &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, you can run the following command and make sure that the &lt;code&gt;userns&lt;/code&gt; is listed under the &lt;code&gt;SecurityOptions&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;docker info --format &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;{{ .SecurityOptions }}&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have confirmed that your containers are not being run as root, you can look at enabling user namespace support on the Docker daemon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;/etc/subuid&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/etc/subgid&lt;/code&gt; host files will be read for the user and optional group supplied to the &lt;code&gt;--userns-remap&lt;/code&gt; option of &lt;code&gt;dockerd&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;--userns-remap&lt;/code&gt; option accepts the following value types:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;uid&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;uid:gid&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;username&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;username:groupname&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The username must exist in the &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt; file, the &lt;code&gt;sbin/nologin&lt;/code&gt; users are &lt;a href=&#34;https://success.docker.com/KBase/Introduction_to_User_Namespaces_in_Docker_Engine&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;also valid&lt;/a&gt;. Subordinate user Id and group Id ranges need to be specified in &lt;code&gt;/etc/subuid&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/etc/subuid&lt;/code&gt; respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;_The UID/GID we want to remap to &lt;a href=&#34;https://success.docker.com/KBase/Introduction_to_User_Namespaces_in_Docker_Engine&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;does not need to match&lt;/a&gt; the UID/GID of the username in &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt;_&amp;ldquo;. It is the entity in the &lt;code&gt;/etc/subuid&lt;/code&gt; that will be the owner of the Docker daemon and the containers it runs. The value you supply to &lt;code&gt;--userns-remap&lt;/code&gt; if numeric Ids, will be translated back to the valid user or group names of &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/etc/group&lt;/code&gt; which must exist, if username, groupname, they must match the entities in &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/etc/subuid&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;/etc/subgid&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, if you do not want to specify your own user and/or user:group, you can provide the &lt;code&gt;default&lt;/code&gt; value to &lt;code&gt;--userns-remap&lt;/code&gt;, and a default user of &lt;code&gt;dockremap&lt;/code&gt; along with subordinate uid and gid ranges that will be created in &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/etc/group&lt;/code&gt; if it does not already exist. Then the &lt;code&gt;/etc/subuid&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/etc/subgid&lt;/code&gt; files will be &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/userns-remap/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;populated&lt;/a&gt; with a contiguous 65536 length range of subordinate user and group Ids respectively, starting at the offset of the existing entries in those files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# As root, run:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;dockerd --userns-remap&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;default
    &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;dockremap&lt;/code&gt; does not already exist, it will be created:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&#34;etc-subuid-and-etc-subgid&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;/etc/subuid and /etc/subgid&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;existinguser&amp;gt;:100000:65536
dockremap:165536:65536
    &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are rules about providing multiple range segments in the &lt;code&gt;/etc/subuid&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/etc/subgid&lt;/code&gt; files, but that is beyond the scope of what I am providing here. For those advanced scenario details, check out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jquast/docker/blob/2fd674a00f98469caa1ceb572e5ae92a68b52f44/docs/reference/commandline/dockerd.md#detailed-information-on-subuidsubgid-ranges&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Docker engine reference&lt;/a&gt;. The simplest scenario is to use a single contiguous range as seen in the above example, this will cause Docker to map the hosts user and group Ids to the container process using as much of the &lt;code&gt;165536:65536&lt;/code&gt; range as necessary. For example, the host&amp;rsquo;s root user would be mapped to &lt;code&gt;165536&lt;/code&gt;, the next host user would be mapped to container user &lt;code&gt;165537&lt;/code&gt;, and so on until the 65536 possible Ids are all mapped. Processes run as root inside the container are owned by the subordinate uid outside of the container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disabling user namespace for specific containers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to disable user namespace mapping, on a per container basis, once enabled for the Docker daemon, you could supply the &lt;code&gt;--userns=host&lt;/code&gt; value to either of the &lt;code&gt;run&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;exec&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;create&lt;/code&gt; Docker commands. This would mean the default user within the container was mapped to the host&amp;rsquo;s root.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;read-only-containers&#34;&gt;Read-only Containers&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to set up read-only hosts, physical or virtual, there is a lot of work to be done, and in some cases, it becomes challenging to stop an Operating System writing to some files. I discussed this in depth in the subsections &amp;ldquo;Partitioning on OS Installation&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Lock Down the
Mounting of Partitions&amp;rdquo; in the VPS chapter of my book: Fascicle 1 of &lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Holistic Info-Sec for Web Developers&lt;/a&gt;. In contrast, running Docker containers as read-only is trivial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running a container with the &lt;code&gt;--read-only&lt;/code&gt; flag stops writes to the container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can sometimes be a little to constraining, as your application may need to write some temporary data locally. You could volume mount a host directory into your container, but this would obviously expose that temporary data to the host, and also other containers that may mount the same host directory. To stop other containers sharing your mounted volume, you would have to employ &lt;a href=&#34;#docker-host-engine-and-containers-namespaces-mnt-labelling&#34;&gt;labeling&lt;/a&gt; with the likes of LSM and apply the &lt;code&gt;Z&lt;/code&gt; suffix at volume mount time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A better, easier and simpler solution would be to apply the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#mount-tmpfs-tmpfs&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;--tmpfs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; flag to one or more directories. &lt;code&gt;--tmpfs&lt;/code&gt; allows the creation of tmpfs (appearing as a mounted file system, but stored in volatile memory) mounts on any local directory, which solves the problem of not being able to write to read-only containers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If an existing directory is specified with the &lt;code&gt;--tmpfs&lt;/code&gt; option, you will experience similar behaviour to that of mounting an empty directory onto an existing one. The directory is initially empty, any additions or modifications to the directories contents will not persist past container stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is an example of running a container as read-only with a writeable tmpfs &lt;code&gt;/tmp&lt;/code&gt; directory:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;docker run -it --rm --read-only --tmpfs /tmp --name&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;my-read-only-container ubuntu&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The default mount flags with &lt;code&gt;--tmpfs&lt;/code&gt; are the same as the Linux default &lt;code&gt;mount&lt;/code&gt; flags, if you do not specify any &lt;code&gt;mount&lt;/code&gt; flags the following will be used:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev,size=65536k&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;runc-and-where-it-fits-in&#34;&gt;runC and Where it Fits in&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Docker engine&lt;/strong&gt; is now built on containerd and runC. Engine creates the image indirectly via containerd -&amp;gt; runC using &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/tree/master/libcontainer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;libcontainer&lt;/a&gt; -&amp;gt; and passes it to containerd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://containerd.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;containerd&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (daemon for Linux or Windows):&lt;br /&gt;
containerd is based on the Docker engine&amp;rsquo;s core container runtime. It manages the complete container life-cycle, managing primitives on Linux and Windows hosts such as the following, whether directly or indirectly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Image transfer and storage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Container execution and supervision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Management of network interfaces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local storage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Native plumbing level API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full Open Container Initiative (OCI) support: image and runtime (runC) specification&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/containerd/containerd&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;containerd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; calls &lt;code&gt;containerd-shim&lt;/code&gt; which uses runC to run the container. &lt;code&gt;containerd-shim&lt;/code&gt; allows the runtime, which is &lt;code&gt;docker-runc&lt;/code&gt; in Docker&amp;rsquo;s case, to exit once it has started the container, thus allowing the container to run without a daemon. You can see this if you run&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;ps aux | grep docker&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In fact, if you run this command you will see how all the components hang together. Viewing this output along with the diagram below, will help solidify your understanding of the relationships between the components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://runc.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;runC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the container runtime that runs containers (think, run Container) according to the OCI specification, runC is a small standalone command line tool (CLI) built on and providing interface to libcontainer, which does most of the work. runC provides interface with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linux Kernel Namespaces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cgroups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linux Security Modules&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capabilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seccomp&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These features have been integrated into the low level, light weight, portable, container runtime CLI called runC, with libcontainer doing the heavy lifting. It has no dependency on the rest of the Docker platform, and has all the code required by Docker to interact with the container specific system features. More correctly, libcontainer is the library that interfaces with the above mentioned kernel features. runC leverages libcontainer directly, without the Docker engine being required in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/opencontainers/runc&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;runC&lt;/a&gt; was created by the OCI, whose goal is to have an industry standard for container runtimes and formats, attempting to ensure that containers built for one engine can run on other engines.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;There are often many issues with any given Development Teams process, such as the following points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The way the individuals communicate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obstacles that slow the Team down unnecessarily&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Waiting on information and decisions from people outside of the team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Team members getting asked to do tasks not on the critical path&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of autonomy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lack of necessary skills and knowledge to create robust, scalable, extensible, maintainable, and secure systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High level of multi-tasking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low morale due to many issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly there can be many technical issues that negatively affect the rapid development of the type of software solution you are trying to get to market, such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High defect counts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code tightly coupled and hard to extend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interfaces, encapsulation and abstractions &lt;a href=&#34;https://binarymist.io/blog/2009/12/24/keeping-encapsulation-on-ones-mind/&#34;&gt;breaking down&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of test coverage, and in some cases too much test coverage in the wrong areas, and even the wrong types of tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not knowing where and how to start in terms of improving your information security stature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Software Developers, often we can&amp;rsquo;t even see the faults in front of us. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s just a matter of not wanting to rock the boat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;imagine-being-able-to-see-what-you-could-never-see-before&#34;&gt;Imagine Being Able To See What You Could Never See Before&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is where a second pair of eyes with the knowledge and experience of working with and mentoring many high performance, security focussed Development Teams, can really provide the visibility you&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for to make the best decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kim&amp;rsquo;s ability to sit within a Development Team for a short period of time, intuitively working with your key stake holders, discussing in brutal honesty where the lowest hanging fruit is in terms of items that are slowing your Team(s) down, and stopping them from reaching their maximum performance and effectiveness has proven immensely valuable to many organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will provide you with the visibility and actionable items you need in order to make the positive changes your Development Team(s) need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a road map, but will provide you with the visibility and quick tips you need in order to make the most important changes quickly. We can help create a &lt;a href=&#34;https://binarymist.io/project/service-development-team-security-roadmap/&#34;&gt;road map&lt;/a&gt; for you if you need additional detail and direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;give-your-development-teams-the-leading-edge&#34;&gt;Give Your Development Teams The Leading Edge&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This service provides a teardown of either one of the following. There will be some cross-over between the two options, but this engagement is only for one of the following two options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your Development Team&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://f0.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap06.html#process-and-practises-agile-development-and-practices&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;process and practises&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we are performing teardown on the process and practises, it will be focussed primarily on the people involved and how they do what they do&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your chosen software project you are currently developing and/or maintaining, reviewing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If performing the project based teardown, the work will be mostly of a technical nature&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;here-s-how-it-works&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s How It Works&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If the area of focus is on your Development Team&amp;rsquo;s process and practises,&lt;br&gt;
Kim will visit your site in person or work with you remotely. We will review the target Development Team and supporting personnel, their process and practises, and how they interact with each other. We will look at how they are performing, document and discuss potential areas for improvement, as well as their areas of strength. We will capitalise on the Teams strengths, and create actionable work items to improve the Teams weak areas and further leverage the Teams strengths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the area of focus is on your chosen software project,&lt;br&gt;
Similarly Kim will visit your site or work with you remotely, reviewing as many of the following artefacts that you can make available as possible, document and discuss potential issues, improvements, and areas where the system is in good shape that can be further capitalised on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build Pipeline / Supply Chain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test Suites (Unit, Integration, Behavioural)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coding Standards, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If working remotely, Kim can video or take annotated screen shots of potential issues and provide guidance on how to improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Each member of the Development Team will receive &lt;strong&gt;free&lt;/strong&gt; copies of the first two parts of Kim&amp;rsquo;s book series &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://binarymist.io/publication/holistic-infosec-for-web-developers/&#34;&gt;Holistic Info-Sec for Web Developers&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; (weighing in at approximately 700 pages) which much of Kim&amp;rsquo;s knowledge and experience has been distilled into. this will serve as an invaluable ongoing self learning, and reference resource to help keep the Team on Track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re ready to lift your Development Teams game and give them the edge they need&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kim Carter was engaged on a contract basis to implement and guide our future software development for School-links. www.school-links.co.nz&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In doing that he -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brought to our product a much &lt;strong&gt;higher level of expertise&lt;/strong&gt; and capability complementing our development team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Directed a disciplined and methodical software development process as the Scrum Master of ‘Scrum’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helped with the restructuring and planning of our infrastructure in order to scale the product successfully&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brings &lt;strong&gt;security expertise&lt;/strong&gt; at a high level with the ability to implement &lt;strong&gt;ongoing security&lt;/strong&gt; hardening program and audits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduced the Scrum process which provided more &lt;strong&gt;consistent and accurate&lt;/strong&gt; release cycles enabling our marketing efforts to be better coordinated and focused&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kim is a good team member and we will look to reengage with his services when required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve met Kim at DevSecCon Singapore in 2017 where he gave a well-received &lt;a href=&#34;https://binarymist.io/talk/devseccon-asia-2017-workshop-developing-a-high-perf-security-focussed-agile-team/&#34;&gt;workshop&lt;/a&gt;. A few months later we had a project where his top-notch strong &lt;strong&gt;Node.js security&lt;/strong&gt; code review skills were required and this gave us the chance to work together closely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over a 2 week period he was doing security code reviews of containerized Node.js &lt;strong&gt;microservices&lt;/strong&gt; in a very thorough way. We communicated well and progressed quickly. Kim has a very broad yet deep understanding of modern application security that comes from years of experience. I can recommend Kim to anyone who needs an &lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap06.html#web-applications&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;application security&lt;/a&gt; expert and wants a professional second opinion on the security posture of an application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kim has had the unique opportunity to work in both defensive (development) and &lt;a href=&#34;https://binarymist.io/talk/nz-js-con-2017-the-art-of-exploitation/&#34;&gt;offensive&lt;/a&gt; (penetration testing) teams, across many domains, for a large number of years. This has produced a deep understanding of what Development Team(s) need in order to help you create solutions that will effectively resist attacks from your adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/IVLpmCtiPZ0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34; title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kim&amp;rsquo;s experience within Development Teams is exhibited frequently at conference &lt;a href=&#34;https://binarymist.io/talk/&#34;&gt;talks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://binarymist.io/project/service-development-team-security-training/&#34;&gt;workshops&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://binarymist.io/publication/#4&#34;&gt;podcasts&lt;/a&gt; that he hosts, and distilled in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://binarymist.io/publication/kims-selected-publications/&#34;&gt;books&lt;/a&gt; he writes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following presentation Kim gave at BSides Wellington was around the additional process and practises that he advocates Development Teams embrace and make part of their culture.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/hRs8lWtR5LM&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34; title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f0.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/toc.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Chapter four&lt;/a&gt; of the first part of the Holistic Info-Sec for Web Developers book series addresses process and practises for Software Developers based on the learnings of the attackers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You owe it to your Development Teams to give them the edge they need to produce the software solutions you require. Don&amp;rsquo;t put it off any longer&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;reserve-your-consultation-1&#34;&gt;Reserve Your Consultation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Currently we have availability for select new clients.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;btn btn-primary btn-outline&#34; href=&#34;https://binarymist.io/#contact&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reserve Your Confidential Consultation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kim only has availability for a few of these engagements per month. Scheduling is first come, first served, so the sooner you book your consultation, the sooner your Development Team will be able to really start performing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.se-radio.net/team/kim-carter/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://binarymist.io/img/publication/se-radio-logo.png&#34; alt=&#34;Software Engineering Radio&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;show-outline&#34;&gt;Show Outline&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;basic-questions&#34;&gt;Basic Questions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is end-to-end encryption?&lt;br /&gt;
(plain text -&amp;gt; cipher text. If there are intermediaries, they can not make sense of the data)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why do we need end-to-end encryption, what’s the goal here?&lt;br /&gt;
(One example would be a European organisation which stores its archived data off-site in the USA. Under the terms of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_PATRIOT_Act&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;USA PATRIOT Act&lt;/a&gt;, American authorities can demand access to all data physically stored within its boundaries, even if it includes personal information on European citizens with no connections to the USA. If the data is E2EE, it’s impossible to yield to the authorities)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are we trying to protect?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who are we trying to protect it from&lt;br /&gt;
(who are the threat actors)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are your thoughts around adding backdoors for the authorities, but somehow stopping the attackers from using them?&lt;br /&gt;
(Examples where this has happened)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For our listeners, can you explain &lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap03.html#leanpub-auto-symmetric-cryptosystems&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;symmetric&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap03.html#leanpub-auto-asymmetric-cryptosystems&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;asymmetric&lt;/a&gt; encryption?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What types of systems can we apply end-to-end encryption to?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What types of systems should we apply end-to-end encryption to?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;scenarios&#34;&gt;Scenarios&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re going to discuss IM, Voice, and Email scenarios briefly,
then move into Inter-service communication scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;im-scenario&#34;&gt;IM Scenario&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We apply end-to-end encryption to Instant Messaging. Some of these offerings are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Signal&lt;br /&gt;
(free &amp;amp; open source. Retain your ph number and last login date, nothing else)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://wire.com/en/security/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Wire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
(open source, swiss headquarters, EU servers, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/wireapp/proteus&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Proteus&lt;/a&gt; is an implementation of the axolotl protocol (later renamed to Double Ratchet Algorithm))&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook messenger if you opt-in&lt;br /&gt;
(Signal protocol, collect lots of metadata from users)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WhatsApp&lt;br /&gt;
(&lt;a href=&#34;https://signal.org/blog/whatsapp-complete/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Signal protocol&lt;/a&gt;, but collect conversation and a lot of other metadata, owned by FaceBook, and users data &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/18/16792448/whatsapp-facebook-data-sharing-no-user-consent&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;goes to FaceBook&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Telegram&lt;br /&gt;
(controversies around their hand rolled MTProto, store lots of metadata)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Viber&lt;br /&gt;
(hand rolled closed source signal protocol)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iMessage&lt;br /&gt;
(iOS, end-to-end encrypted, closed source, possibly has a back door)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are your thoughts around these offerings and their ethics?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;voice-scenario&#34;&gt;Voice Scenario&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve got Voice calls with offerings such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Signal has voice and video over IP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SilentCircle offerings such as Silent Phone&lt;br /&gt;
(source open &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.silentcircle.com/kb/article/121-is-silent-phone-open-source&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;for review&lt;/a&gt;, but not free)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FaceTime&lt;br /&gt;
(iOS, end-to-end encrypted, closed source, possibly has a back door)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WhatsApp&lt;br /&gt;
(as with IM)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skype&lt;br /&gt;
(&lt;a href=&#34;https://cointelegraph.com/news/3-alternatives-to-skype-surveillance-with-end-to-end-encrypted-calls&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;spy-ware&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are your thoughts around these offerings and their ethics?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;email-scenario&#34;&gt;Email Scenario&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not end-to-end encrypted, unless using &lt;a href=&#34;https://binarymist.io/blog/2015/01/31/gnupg-key-pair-with-sub-keys/&#34;&gt;GPG/PGP&lt;/a&gt;, which is a pain. TLS provides encryption to the server, STARTTLS can provide encryption between the servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google made &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/30/5046958/nsa-secretly-taps-into-google-yahoo-networks-to-collect-information&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;various announcements&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&#34;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/11/googlers-say-f-you-to-nsa-company-encrypts-internal-network/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;late 2013&lt;/a&gt; through to about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theverge.com/2014/3/20/5530072/google-encrypts-gmail-between-data-centers-to-keep-out-nsa&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;March 2014&lt;/a&gt; that they now provide not only mandatory TLS encryption between clients and their servers, but also &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/security/security-design/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;between their own data centres&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is good, but it’s not necessarily E2EE, there are transitional seams at each server when the data goes from resting to in-transit. The NSA and GCHQ more than likely have backdoors into Google servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it’s safe to say, if we want email or any cloud privacy for that matter, we need to take the responsibility ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there any hope here, how can we improve the email situation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;inter-service-communication-scenarios&#34;&gt;Inter-Service Communication Scenarios&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Software Engineers, we’re building complex and distributed systems to run on servers we know very little about (AKA the Cloud), this is untrusted territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why do we need encryption between these components?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why does it need to be end to end?&lt;br /&gt;
(Stop attackers intercepting, both hackers and nation states)&lt;br /&gt;
(How could an attacker leverage the seam?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Securing data at rest and in transit is generally a solved problem, but securing data in use is harder. If we can achieve this, then we can achieve E2EE. If we have to decrypt in order to process, then we have a seam, and this is where attackers will focus their efforts.&lt;br /&gt;
Rather than creating a seam in our E2EE by decrypting to perform processing, let’s look at some techniques for securing &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_in_use&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;data in use&lt;/a&gt;, thus providing E2EE&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;full-memory-encryption-e2ee-data-in-use-techniques&#34;&gt;Full memory encryption (E2EE data in use techniques)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system provides both confidentiality and integrity protections of code and data which are encrypted everywhere outside the CPU boundary&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you explain how this works, and how Software Engineers can take advantage of it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;cpu-based-key-storage-e2ee-data-in-use-techniques&#34;&gt;CPU-based Key Storage (E2EE data in use techniques)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where a kernel patch provides CPU-only based encryption to defend against &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_boot_attack&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;cold boot attacks&lt;/a&gt;, allowing RAM to be treated as untrusted. Can you tell us a bit about this and whether Software Engineers could be, and should be making use of it in our systems?&lt;br /&gt;
(Implementations: &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRESOR&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;TRESOR&lt;/a&gt;, Loop-Amnesia)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;enclaves-e2ee-data-in-use-techniques&#34;&gt;Enclaves (E2EE data in use techniques)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We touched on Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) in the show on &lt;a href=&#34;https://binarymist.io/publication/ser-podcast-docker-security/&#34;&gt;Docker Security (#290)&lt;/a&gt;
Data in enclaves is encrypted in RAM, but clear text within the CPU and its cache.
Intel introduced the concept of enclaves as part of its SGX, providing a set of new SGX-enabled CPU instructions (18) allowing user-level code to allocate private regions of memory known as enclaves.&lt;br /&gt;
Intel has the concept of the symmetrical provisioning key which resides in both the SGX-enabled chip and in Intel servers.&lt;br /&gt;
To establish an enclave, the software needs to offer its provisioning key to Intel, and if there&amp;rsquo;s a match in their database, Intel will issue an attestation key that lets SGX set up the enclave.&lt;br /&gt;
The SGX patents disclose in no uncertain terms that the Launch Enclave was introduced to ensure that each enclave’s author has a business relationship with Intel, and implements a software licensing system&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SGX has been &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/02/01/sgx_secure_until_you_look_at_the_detail/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;heavily criticised&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/086.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;security researches&lt;/a&gt; (Victor Costan and Srinivas Devadas of MIT). As far as I can tell, by using SGX, we’re just shifting our trust from untrusted clouds to Intel?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you explain how enclaves work, what theoretical and real benefit this provides us if any?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;cryptographic-protocols-e2ee-data-in-use-techniques&#34;&gt;Cryptographic Protocols (E2EE data in use techniques)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Secure multi-party computation&lt;/a&gt; (AKA secure computation or privacy-preserving computation), the idea here is to create methods for parties to jointly compute a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs private&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Homomorphic encryption&lt;/a&gt; allows us to perform computations on ciphertext, the result being the result of the operations as though they had been performed on plaintext but still encrypted&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you explain a bit about “Secure multi-party computation” and “Homomorphic encryption” and how they differ?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can your average Software Engineer utilise these within their solutions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve talked about securing data in use, what are the best options for todays Software Engineers to perform processing on encrypted data?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;transition-from-e2ee-to-encryption-between-points-of-communication&#34;&gt;Transition from E2EE to Encryption between points of communication&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We touched on what CSPs are doing to encrypt our comms between data centres, services and components in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://binarymist.io/publication/ser-podcast-cloud-security/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Cloud Security show&lt;/a&gt; with AWS security specialist Scott Piper (#314). It basically comes down to: we don’t really know what they’re doing, so this is the Developer’s responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you add anything to this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can setup mutual TLS authentication between our components. What other options, tools and techniques do we have available to us as Software Engineers, when performing computation on encrypted data isn’t an option?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;libraries-ciphers-and-tools&#34;&gt;Libraries, Ciphers and Tools&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a huge amount of poor advice on the internet, stackoverflow, etc. Let’s get some solid advice for our Engineers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which ciphers and modes should we be avoiding, and which should we be using for which purpose?&lt;br /&gt;
(&lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap06.html#web-applications-identify-risks-cryptography-on-the-client&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Avoid: AES-CBC&lt;/a&gt;. Use: AES256 block cipher with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap06.html#web-applications-risks-that-solution-causes-cryptography-on-the-client&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;GCM cipher mode&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which Libraries (native and others) should we avoid, and which should we be using?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can be hard for Software Engineers to know &lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap06.html#web-applications-countermeasures-data-store-compromise-which-kdf-to-use&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;which ciphers and KDFs they should use&lt;/a&gt;. What do we need to look for in a library?&lt;br /&gt;
(Created by cryptographers, few options, only tried and tested ciphers, if in doubt, ask an expert not stackoverflow)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;tresorit-non-convergent-crypto&#34;&gt;Tresorit Non-convergent Crypto&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tresorit uses non-convergent crypto to store users data, can you talk a bit about what this means and how this works?&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Sat, 24 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +1300</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://binarymist.io/blog/2018/02/24/hugo-with-staticman-commenting-and-subscriptions/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Continuing on from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://binarymist.io/blog/2018/01/27/binarymist-web-migration/&#34;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt;, in which we set-up the BinaryMist blog and business site on Hugo, it was now time to provide some functionality for you to be able to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#leave-comments-on-posts&#34;&gt;Leave comments on posts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#subscribe-to-comments-on-specific-blog-posts&#34;&gt;Subscribe to comments on specific blog posts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#subscribe-to-notification-by-email-as-new-blog-posts-are-published&#34;&gt;Subscribe to notification by email as new blog posts are published&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hugo &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/content-management/comments/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;uses Disqus&lt;/a&gt; as it&amp;rsquo;s default reader commenting system which is a shame, as &lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap06.html#leanpub-auto-alternative-approaches&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Disqus is evil&lt;/a&gt;, but never fear, I&amp;rsquo;ve gone ahead and got a commenting system set-up for the Academic theme that won&amp;rsquo;t abuse you. Your comments are actually hosted from the same place as this website is running from, your email address is md5 hashed, so it&amp;rsquo;s not visible to the public in clear text anywhere. For example, this is the hash of my email address:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;01486cfc6aa638a6f8e85142c645fcd7&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-s-on-offer&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s on Offer?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reviewed the &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/content-management/comments/#comments-alternatives&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;other offerings&lt;/a&gt; promoted by Hugo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disqus: As discussed, No thanks!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Texpen: Their site doesn&amp;rsquo;t respond for me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IntenseDebate: Closed source (I think). Looks like they want to sign the consumer up, I&amp;rsquo;m guessing this costs money. What ever their deal is, they&amp;rsquo;re not up-front enough about it for me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GraphComment: Closed source&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mutt: Closed source, costs money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;isso: Python and open (great), but the consumer has to self host, may not be a show stopper, but we can do better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leaves the free and open &lt;a href=&#34;https://staticman.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Staticman&lt;/a&gt;. You can see some of the other sites that use Staticman &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman#sites-using-staticman&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Staticman ticked all of my boxes, apart from the fact I&amp;rsquo;d like to see some more contributors to the project, but hay, if that is honestly a problem, then I should be contributing, and I guess I am in a small way. In saying that, Worst case scenario, is that the project becomes dormant, and one of the consumers, will need to become a producer, and/or we have to self host it. Big ups to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/eduardoboucas&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;@eduardoboucas&lt;/a&gt; for running this project for free, and in his spare time. It&amp;rsquo;s people like this that make the open source world what it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;staticman-it-is-let-s-move-on&#34;&gt;Staticman it is, Let&amp;rsquo;s move on&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you subscribe to &lt;a href=&#34;#comments&#34;&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt; on any of the BinaryMist blog posts, your email address will be stored in a mailing list that I control. You can unsubscribe at any time, and I will not spam you. You can also tell me to remove you at any time and I will make sure your request is honoured. If you check the &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Notify me of new comments on this post&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; (on this or any other post), your email will go into my private mailing list, and will also only be visible as a hash in a Github pull request. That&amp;rsquo;s right, they look like this (&lt;code&gt;01486cfc6aa638a6f8e85142c645fcd7&lt;/code&gt;) remember? You can also see what these look like &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/binarymist/BinaryMistBlog/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I had decided to go the Staticman route, I needed to consolidate on the documentation, examples, and start to build a picture of how this was going to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Beautifulhugo theme &lt;a href=&#34;https://themes.gohugo.io/beautifulhugo#staticman-support&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;appear(es|ed) to support&lt;/a&gt; Staticman, but there was no relevant config in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/halogenica/beautifulhugo/blob/ebfb6b87803f906382775ba90efdd9e1ebf31280/exampleSite/config.toml&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/halogenica/beautifulhugo/tree/ebfb6b87803f906382775ba90efdd9e1ebf31280/exampleSite&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;staticman.yml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Let me know if I have missed some of their documentation that explains the required config? The &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/halogenica/beautifulhugo/blob/ebfb6b87803f906382775ba90efdd9e1ebf31280/layouts/_default/single.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;single.html&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; layout and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/halogenica/beautifulhugo/blob/ebfb6b87803f906382775ba90efdd9e1ebf31280/layouts/partials/staticman-comments.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;staticman-comments.html&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was marginally helpful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The gohugohq &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugohq.com/howto/staticman-hugo-comment-system/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;howto&lt;/a&gt; was also marginally helpful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I had to do this again I would ignore both of the above Beautifulhugo and gohugohq examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Staticman &lt;a href=&#34;https://staticman.net/docs/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;official documentation&lt;/a&gt; is good, but will be even better with a little more time, the info is there, just that some of it is not as clear as it could be, but I know it&amp;rsquo;s being improved as we speak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;leave-comments-on-posts&#34;&gt;Leave Comments on Posts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creator of Staticman was nice enough to create a model Hugo site to demo Staticman working with Hugo. The following were the most helpful examples to set this up with Hugo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demo site: &lt;a href=&#34;https://hugo.staticman.net/post/my-entry/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://hugo.staticman.net/post/my-entry/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Config file: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/eduardoboucas/hugo-plus-staticman/blob/master/staticman.yml&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://github.com/eduardoboucas/hugo-plus-staticman/blob/master/staticman.yml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The layout partial that handles the markup for the comment display and posting: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/eduardoboucas/hugo-plus-staticman/blob/master/themes/hugo-type-theme/layouts/partials/post-comments.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://github.com/eduardoboucas/hugo-plus-staticman/blob/master/themes/hugo-type-theme/layouts/partials/post-comments.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I used the style-sheet from the Staticman creators &lt;a href=&#34;https://eduardoboucas.com/blog/2017/11/14/static-api-generator.html#post-new-comment&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;own website&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/eduardoboucas/eduardoboucas.github.io&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;) for the &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Notify me of new comments on this post&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; checkbox as a starting point&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order for the comment count to be displayed in the &lt;code&gt;article_metadata.html&lt;/code&gt; (That&amp;rsquo;s at the top of each post and listed under each posts title in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://binarymist.io/blog&#34;&gt;list&lt;/a&gt;), the blog posts &lt;code&gt;slug&lt;/code&gt; needs to be in the front matter of each post:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-md&#34; data-lang=&#34;md&#34;&gt;# Slug is required for counting comments.
slug = &amp;#34;blog-post-file-name-without-md&amp;#34;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you decide to have Staticman issue a pull request for each reader comment (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://staticman.net/docs/index.html#step-4-approve-entries-optional&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;step 4&lt;/a&gt; of the getting started guide), you can also &lt;a href=&#34;https://staticman.net/docs/webhooks&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;set-up a webhook&lt;/a&gt; to have Static man delete the branch once you have accepted or closed the pull request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;subscribe-to-comments-on-specific-blog-posts&#34;&gt;Subscribe to Comments on Specific Blog Posts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where you set-up a Mailgun account and your domain within it. Go ahead and sign up for a free Mailgun account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most useful piece of documentation for this was an &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman/issues/42&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;issue thread&lt;/a&gt; in which @eduardoboucas explained how this should work. Some of the following comments on the thread were also useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman/blob/master/staticman.sample.yml&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;staticman.sample.yml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which you copied to your sites root directory and modified, based on the directions in the official &lt;a href=&#34;https://staticman.net/docs/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;, you will need to uncomment the &lt;code&gt;#notifications:&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;#enabled: true&lt;/code&gt; and add your encrypted &lt;code&gt;apiKey&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;domain&lt;/code&gt; that Staticman &lt;a href=&#34;https://staticman.net/docs/encryption&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;encrypts&lt;/a&gt; for you (also discussed in the issue thread mentioned above) if you use the API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;subscribe-to-notification-by-email-as-new-blog-posts-are-published&#34;&gt;Subscribe to notification by email as new blog posts are published&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I had the above set-up and working, this step only took an afternoon. What was involved:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added the &lt;code&gt;blogSubscribers&lt;/code&gt; section to &lt;code&gt;staticman.yml&lt;/code&gt;, I will discus this when we look at the code in the next section&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added the &lt;code&gt;post.html&lt;/code&gt; (shown below). This will &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt; your subscription, and display a confirmation screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some more styling added to &lt;code&gt;override.css&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On first &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt; the mailing list will be created in your Mailgun account. I then just gave it a sensible name, so I can see what the purpose of the list is at a glance, as Staticman provides a &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman/issues/42#issuecomment-283981036&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;MD5 hash of the Github username, repository, and entry id concatenated together&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; which is prefixed to the Alias Address of the new Mailgun mailing list that you can send notifications to. If you have &lt;code&gt;moderation: true&lt;/code&gt; in your &lt;code&gt;staticman.yml&lt;/code&gt; under the section responsible for this (&lt;code&gt;blogSubscribers&lt;/code&gt; in my case), you will receive a pull request each time someone subscribes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are like me and would like to address notifications to a name/handle, the following is currently required:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I receive the Github pull request from Staticman for blog subscription, if it looks legitimate, I need to &lt;code&gt;md5sum&lt;/code&gt; the email address in the new Mailgun record:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;echo -n &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;the-email-address-from-mailgun-record&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; | md5sum&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
and compare the result with the hashed email in the pull request. Then take the name from that pull request and apply it to the Mailgun entry. This is a small piece of manual work that would be nice if Staticman could send the name as well and have it added to the email records &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pull request can be closed, unless for some reason you want it merged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;sending-email-to-subscribers&#34;&gt;Sending Email to Subscribers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have the above set-up, sending the email is as simple as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;curl -s --user &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;api:key-[key-hash-goes-here]&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;   https://api.mailgun.net/v3/mailgun.binarymist.io/messages &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;   -F from&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;lt;your-name&amp;gt; &amp;lt;email-address-that-subscribers-can-reply-to&amp;gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;\

&lt;h2 id=&#34;show-me-the-code&#34;&gt;Show me the Code&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, all of this is up and running on the blog you are reading now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may also notice the &lt;code&gt;botpot&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;input&lt;/code&gt; field on both forms. This is from a mitigations &lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap06.html#web-applications-countermeasures-captcha&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;section&lt;/a&gt; in the Web Applications chapter of my second book around captchas, and how they place the website owners problem on the end uers. Bots are not the end users problem, so why should they have to jump through hoops to submit a simple form? Check out my research on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap06.html#leanpub-auto-captcha&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The problem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap06.html#web-applications-countermeasures-captcha&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The solution(s)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enough ranting&amp;hellip; The following are the new parts I added to &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&#34;modified-file-config-toml-https-github-com-binarymist-binarymistblog-blob-master-config-toml&#34;&gt;Modified File: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/binarymist/BinaryMistBlog/blob/master/config.toml&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-toml&#34; data-lang=&#34;toml&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# Comment out disqusShortname Key/Value pair&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;#disqusShortname = &amp;#34;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# Add the following new Table somewhere under the params table&lt;/span&gt;
  [&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;staticman&lt;/span&gt;]
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;endpoint&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;https://api.staticman.net/v2/entry&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;username&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;binarymist&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;repository&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;BinaryMistBlog&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;branch&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;master&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&#34;new-file-staticman-yml-https-github-com-binarymist-binarymistblog-blob-master-staticman-yml&#34;&gt;New File: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/binarymist/BinaryMistBlog/blob/master/staticman.yml&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;staticman.yml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is required by Staticman. You&amp;rsquo;ll notice I have a &lt;code&gt;comments&lt;/code&gt; section and a &lt;code&gt;blogSubscribers&lt;/code&gt; section. The former is used by Staticman when you submit a comment on a specific post, you can see this in action &lt;a href=&#34;#comments&#34;&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;. The latter is used by Staticman when you subscribe to be notified of a new blog post, you can see this in action &lt;a href=&#34;https://binarymist.io/blog&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. If all you need is blog comments, you only need the &lt;code&gt;comments&lt;/code&gt; section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&#34;new-override-layouts-partials-comments-html-https-github-com-binarymist-binarymistblog-blob-master-layouts-partials-comments-html&#34;&gt;New Override: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/binarymist/BinaryMistBlog/blob/master/layouts/partials/comments.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;/layouts/partials/comments.html&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;comments.html&lt;/code&gt; is used for posting and subscribing to each specific blog post comment thread, and was copied from &lt;code&gt;/themes/academic/layouts/partials/&lt;/code&gt; and modified extensively. The first lines diff:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-diff&#34; data-lang=&#34;diff&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;- {{ if and .Site.DisqusShortname (not (or .Site.Params.disable_comments .Params.disable_comments)) }}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;+ {{ if and (or .Site.DisqusShortname .Site.Params.staticman) (not (or .Site.Params.disable_comments .Params.disable_comments)) }}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lines 3 - 4 and 6 - 71 are brand new lines:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt;, you can provide style overrides:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-toml&#34; data-lang=&#34;toml&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;custom_css&lt;/span&gt; = [&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;override.css&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relevant styling is all commented and looks like the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-css&#34; data-lang=&#34;css&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7c7c79&#34;&gt;122&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;/* Staticman comment section and form */&lt;/span&gt;

      <title>Workshop - Building Security Into Your Development Teams</title>
      <link>https://binarymist.io/talk/owaspnzday-2018-workshop-building-security-into-your-development-team/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://binarymist.io/img/talk/2018-owasp-workshop.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;owasp new zealand day 2018 workshop&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few organisations understand the &lt;a href=&#34;https://binarymist.io/talk/all-day-devops--talk-secrets-of-a-high-performance-security-focussed-agile-team&#34;&gt;secrets&lt;/a&gt; of shifting the focus on security from late in the software development life-cycle to within the Development Team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only does this significantly reduce the number of security defects being pushed to your production systems, but also significantly reduces the total cost of development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;cheapest-place-https-f0-holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers-com-chap06-html-leanpub-auto-cheapest-place-to-deal-with-defects-to-deal-with-defects&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f0.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap06.html#leanpub-auto-cheapest-place-to-deal-with-defects&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Cheapest place&lt;/a&gt; to deal with defects&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been many studies specifically looking at the costs of finding and fixing defects early, as opposed to the planning of how to fix defects once the product is delivered, or not planning at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following table shows the average cost of fixing defects based on when they were introduced versus when they are detected. Putting these practises in the right order can reduce costs of fixing security defects by up to 100 times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f0.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap06.html#leanpub-auto-cheapest-place-to-deal-with-defects&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://binarymist.io/img/project/AverageCostOfFixingDefects.png&#34; alt=&#34;average cost of fixing defects&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So&amp;hellip; by simply shifting the security expertise from the end of the project to within the development team, thus enabling developers to find and fix their defects as they are being introduced, huge cost savings can be enjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not as difficult as you may think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-the-day&#34;&gt;On the Day&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kim will lead the class through the tools, techniques and thought processes of both red (attacking) and blue (defending) teams along with how to combine these attributes into the purple team focussing on security, productivity, and tasked with continuously delivering sustainable maintainable technical solutions to market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kim will explain the roles of &amp;rsquo;T&amp;rsquo; shaped professionals, including placement of security champions to create your purple Development Teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will work through how to implement the Sensible Security Model (SSM) within each and every Sprint, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating actionable countermeasure Product Backlog Items&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrating them into the same Product Backlog that your Development Team has been pulling business focussed items from&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ordering them based on the risk ratings you create for each&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://binarymist.io/img/project/Countermeasures-Backlog.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;countermeasures backlog&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kim will discuss how and where Agile Development Teams often fail, along with how to succeed with security with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://f0.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap06.html#leanpub-auto-how-and-why-many-software-development-shops-fail&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;familiar anecdote&lt;/a&gt;. Then augmenting your Scrum process within each and every Sprint, with a collection of development focussed &lt;a href=&#34;http://f0.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap06.html#process-and-practises-agile-development-and-practices&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;processes and practises&lt;/a&gt;, tools and techniques that have proven their value at drastically reducing defects before production deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kim will walk us through the SSM threat modelling process with theory and hands on exercises in areas such as Physical, People, VPS, Network, Cloud and Web Applications. Including sub topics such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://binarymist.io/publication/docker-security/&#34;&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap05.html#cloud-countermeasures-serverless&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Serverless&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://binarymist.io/talk/isig-2017-workshop-windows-exploitation-and-persistence-with-ps/&#34;&gt;PowerShell&lt;/a&gt; and many others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;more-detail-h4&#34;&gt;More Detail&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training material will be augmented with Extracts from Kim&amp;rsquo;s interviews on Software Engineering Radio with security experts such as Diogo Mónica (&lt;a href=&#34;https://binarymist.io/publication/ser-podcast-docker-security/&#34;&gt;Docker Security&lt;/a&gt; Team Lead) and &lt;a href=&#34;https://binarymist.io/publication/ser-podcast-network-security&#34;&gt;Haroon Meer&lt;/a&gt; (creator of Canary tools and tokens).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Each student will receive &lt;strong&gt;free&lt;/strong&gt; copies of the first two parts of Kim&amp;rsquo;s book series &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://binarymist.io/publication/holistic-infosec-for-web-developers/&#34;&gt;Holistic Info-Sec for Web Developers&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; (weighing in at approximately 700 pages) which this training is based on, as companion course material to accompany the training, to assist with ongoing self learning, and as a valuable reference resource long after the training has finished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coverage of topic chapters:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;synopsis&#34;&gt;Synopsis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last four to five years I&amp;rsquo;ve been researching alternative bloggnig platforms in order to move from the Wordpress.com platform I&amp;rsquo;ve been blogging from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss the migration and consolidation of both the BinaryMist blog, and business site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;from&#34;&gt;From:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;business-site&#34;&gt;Business Site&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full custom Nodejs/Express in Docker container on AWS EC2, behind Cloudflare, using my &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/binarymist/aws-docker-host&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;aws-docker-host&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;blog&#34;&gt;Blog&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wordpress.com&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;to&#34;&gt;To:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;all-in-one-business-site-with-blog-you-re-looking-at-it-now&#34;&gt;All in one: Business Site with Blog (you&amp;rsquo;re looking at it now)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hugo with customised Academic theme&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Staticman for blog commenting (See the &lt;a href=&#34;#comments&#34;&gt;bottom of this post&lt;/a&gt; for the working example), as we will discuss in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://binarymist.io/blog/2018/02/24/hugo-with-staticman-commenting-and-subscriptions&#34;&gt;next post&lt;/a&gt;, along with sign-up for receiving new post notifications as they are published (See the &lt;a href=&#34;https://binarymist.io/blog&#34;&gt;post list&lt;/a&gt; for the working example)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hosted directly from Github (&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/binarymist/BinaryMistBlog/tree/gh-pages&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;gh-pages&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sitting behind Cloudflare. Cloudflare handles DNS, TLS, caching and expiration, minification, pretty much everything anyone would need for a static and in many cases dynamic website. When Github goes down, Cloudflare continues to serve your cached site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why&#34;&gt;Why?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wordpress.com has so many issues that really bugged me. One of my goals was to do everything for no monetary cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the issues I had with The free Wordpress.com platform, unless I paid them money, and even if I did, most of these issues remain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inflexibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-extensibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buggy (especially for dealing with source code)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Archaic workflow (logging in, admin interface, no source control)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very limited customisation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unable to apply styling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always felt like I was fighting the platform to do just about anything&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple view ports were not well supported&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No control over improving performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backups were a pain, I used &lt;a href=&#34;https://binarymist.wordpress.com/2011/07/28/shell-script-to-provide-monthly-backup-of-your-blog/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;wget&lt;/code&gt; scripts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Charged for domain masking. All Github requires is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/binarymist/BinaryMistBlog/blob/gh-pages/CNAME&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;CNAME&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So many other issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;requirements&#34;&gt;Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Industry standard markdown instead of some flaky Wordpress editor that always tries to help your formatting, but ends up just getting in your way and doing it wrong. The code highlighting was a prime example of this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ideally I wanted to be able to easily display Github gists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work in source control, stay in the terminal and a text editor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vibrant community. With 104 posts over 8 years on Wordpress.com, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to understand that I take blogging seriously, so I need a platform that is going to be supported for a long time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have complete control of the entire system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easily share blog posts to social media platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to add tags and categories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; attributes added to headings in posts (ideally automatically)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Email notification of new blog posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reader commenting and subscription to comment threads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to label posts with the author (Hugo is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/issues/220&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;working&lt;/a&gt; on this). Not a show stopper for me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search: Wordpress.com has good search, and I find it really useful to find content that I know I&amp;rsquo;ve written about but can&amp;rsquo;t remember where it is&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;platforms-investigated&#34;&gt;Platforms Investigated&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following platforms are listed in order of least interesting to me -&amp;gt; to most. I have a bias toward Nodejs, but as you&amp;rsquo;ll see, the platform I chose wasn&amp;rsquo;t based on Nodejs. A lot of the information I used leading up to the final decision wasn&amp;rsquo;t recorded, as many of the reviews were carried out over the four to five year period, but I did keep an ordered list which was quite fluid, and this is what it looked like, from lowest scoring to highest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;wheat&#34;&gt;Wheat&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Built on Nodejs. No longer actively maintained.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://howtonode.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;howtonode.org&lt;/a&gt; was running on Wheat. Browsing to now yields &lt;code&gt;Internal Server Error&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;wheat2&lt;/code&gt; used to be at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/c9/nog&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://github.com/c9/nog&lt;/a&gt; but now yields &lt;code&gt;404&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
All the other resources I had links to are now dead.&lt;br /&gt;
I think we can safely say Wheat is dead. Please correct me if you know something I don&amp;rsquo;t on Wheat?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cool! I like React. Community, docs, activity? Ah&amp;hellip; no.&lt;/p&gt;

Don&amp;rsquo;t ask me to much about it now&amp;hellip; it was four years ago. 😨&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;hugo&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Written in Go, Hugo has been around since June 2013, and is reaching maturity quickly. Has a very large base of consumers and committers. Excellent documentation, both official and community provided. Has hundreds of customisable themes produced by many contributors. Builds your pages of markdown in &amp;lt; 1 ms per page. There is no such thing as waiting for your site to build. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent about four weeks on the BinaryMist site and it&amp;rsquo;s a dream to work with. Instant live reload out of the box also makes working with Hugo frictionless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the content you will need to create can be done so in markdown, in your file-system, in source control, in the terminal. Backups are no longer an issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any of the theme aspects you can override, simply by copying the specific template or partial from your chosen theme layout directory to the same structure within your sites root directory and making your desired modifications. If you make large changes, consider submitting them back to the theme repository by way of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/pull/438&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Pull Request&lt;/a&gt; (go-on, give back), which is what I did with my Staticman additions to the Academic theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hugo has &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;shortcodes&lt;/a&gt; for many things. such as embedding &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#speakerdeck&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;speakerdeck&lt;/a&gt; presentations, different video formats, (examples &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/talk/js-remote-conf-2017-the-art-of-exploitation/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#tweet&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;tweets&lt;/a&gt;, (&lt;a href=&#34;https://binarymist.io/project/service-development-team-security-training/#what-others-are-saying&#34;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;), plus you can create your own custom shortcodes. Gists are easily pulled in with the Hugo &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#gist&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;gist shortcode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hugo &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;highlight&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shortcode is powerful, flexible, and just seems to work well. Many languages and styles are supported out of the box (code examples below are using it). If for some reason, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t give you enough power, then just use something else. You&amp;rsquo;re not locked into anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/tools/search/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Search&lt;/a&gt;, although I haven&amp;rsquo;t got &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/aerobatic/hugo-search-demo&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; set-up yet. Let me know if you would find this helpful. Either &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/#contact&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;contact me&lt;/a&gt;, leave a &lt;a href=&#34;#comments&#34;&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/binarymist/BinaryMistBlog/issues&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;submit an issue&lt;/a&gt;, as I&amp;rsquo;m generally lazy and may not get a round to it unless someone puts some pressure on me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem for me was migrating existing Wordpress.com posts. I ended up just creating a collection of redirects to the legacy posts. In saying that, some appear to have had better success, but I just gave up on migrating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/thomasf/exitwp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Exitwp&lt;/a&gt; seems to be the main tool for (WP -&amp;gt;) Immigrants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;hugo-themes&#34;&gt;Hugo Themes&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knock yourself out: &lt;a href=&#34;https://themes.gohugo.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://themes.gohugo.io/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose &lt;a href=&#34;https://themes.gohugo.io/academic/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Academic&lt;/a&gt;, as it was the closest fit for when I realised I could combine both blog and business site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, I was still thinking I&amp;rsquo;d have to host the website in a Docker container using my &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/binarymist/aws-docker-host&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;aws-docker-host&lt;/a&gt; which works flawlessly and costs nothing, but as Docker is completely unnecessary if you have Github with a decent CDN in front of it, like Cloudflare, I&amp;rsquo;ll skip the process I took to work out how that would be done. If you are interested, just ask in the &lt;a href=&#34;#comments&#34;&gt;comments section&lt;/a&gt; bellow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-process&#34;&gt;The Process&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I needed to move the legacy BinaryMist blog, which was long over due for this, from Wordpress.com to Github. I&amp;rsquo;ve added redirect stubs to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://binarymist.io/blog&#34;&gt;list of posts&lt;/a&gt;, that lead to many of the legacy posts on the Wordpress.com platform which haven&amp;rsquo;t been migrated to the new platform. Going forward, all posts will be published from &lt;a href=&#34;https://binarymist.io/blog&#34;&gt;binarymist.io/blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I found the theme for Hugo that would work best for my needs, I realised, I&amp;rsquo;d be able to not only migrate the blog, but also the BinaryMist business site, both to a really flexible platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can work on blog posts on a specific branch without pushing to Github until finished, or just mark them as &lt;code&gt;draft = true&lt;/code&gt;, or put the &lt;code&gt;date&lt;/code&gt; to sometime in the future in the post&amp;rsquo;s front-matter. This allows one to work on other content and merge reader comments (if you have them set-up, which &lt;a href=&#34;#comments&#34;&gt;I do&lt;/a&gt;) which are issued as pull requests directly into this Github repo by Staticman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;setting-up-hugo&#34;&gt;Setting up Hugo&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was playing with the Academic theme, and reading a blog post from the Academic creator, the version of Hugo in the Ubuntu Software Sources was very old, so I installed Hugo (.deb binary) on my machines, starting with the directions &lt;a href=&#34;https://georgecushen.com/create-your-website-with-hugo/#installing-hugo&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, which linked to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hugo Releases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;cd ~
wget https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.31/hugo_0.31_Linux-64bit.deb &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# or what ever the latest version is.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# This is where you should check the checksum... Then:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;sudo dpkg -i hugo*.deb&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I had Hugo installed, I Worked through step 2 and 3 of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;quick start guide&lt;/a&gt; to create the site, committing each change as I went:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my local Source directory:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;hugo new site BinaryMistBlog
cd BinaryMistBlog
git init
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# As I had decided to use the academic theme:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git submodule add https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic.git themes/academic&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now from step 3, 4 and 5 of the Installation section of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/academic/post/getting-started/#installation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Getting Started&lt;/a&gt; post from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/academic/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Demo&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/tree/master/exampleSite&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;exampleSite&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# Copy the example site to that which will become your personal site
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;cp -av themes/academic/exampleSite/* .
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# Start hugo
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;hugo server&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, &lt;code&gt;hugo server&lt;/code&gt; is about the only command I use when working on my site. There is one other script that gets used to make my site live, but I&amp;rsquo;ll cover that in a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;ve done any customisations you may want to do to your new site (of course you can do this latter instead if you like), it&amp;rsquo;s  time to set-up how you are going to deploy your static site. For me, hosting directly from where your source control is is a no-brainer. Once this is set-up, there is one script to run every time you want to deploy, which as I said, I&amp;rsquo;ll cover soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose to have my source on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/binarymist/BinaryMistBlog/tree/master&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;master&lt;/a&gt; branch, and my generated site (which is generated to the &lt;code&gt;public/&lt;/code&gt; directory of my local sites root directory, on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/binarymist/BinaryMistBlog/tree/gh-pages&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;gh-pages&lt;/a&gt; branch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the following steps, I needed to install the latest git as there was a bug in the current version in the Ubuntu Software Sources that affects the git &lt;code&gt;worktree&lt;/code&gt; feature. The resources I used for this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/3232&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/3232&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/github-deployment-using-worktrees-failing/5918/7&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/github-deployment-using-worktrees-failing/5918/7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/simple-deployment-to-gh-pages/5003&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/simple-deployment-to-gh-pages/5003&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
which led to:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/33617/how-can-i-update-to-a-newer-version-of-git-using-apt-get&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/33617/how-can-i-update-to-a-newer-version-of-git-using-apt-get&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get your new git:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;sudo add-apt-repository ppa:git-core/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now&amp;hellip; for the next steps, head on over to: &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/#deployment-from-your-gh-pages-branch&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Preparations for &lt;code&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; Branch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then add the commands to a script as the documentation &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/#put-it-into-a-script&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;suggests&lt;/a&gt;. There is a script that you can take and customise. My script looks like &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/binarymist/BinaryMistBlog/blob/master/publish-to-gh-pages.sh&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;#!/bin/bash
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# Run from public

&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;git status -s&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-hugo-workflow&#34;&gt;My Hugo Workflow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, so we&amp;rsquo;re ready to start &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/themes/customizing/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;customising&lt;/a&gt; our site and blogging. My workflow involves one console (&lt;a href=&#34;https://binarymist.io/blog/2013/01/19/a-decent-console-for-windows/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;terminator&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, that&amp;rsquo;s on Linux of course) split into four terminals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Terminal 1 runs &lt;code&gt;hugo server&lt;/code&gt;, I leave this running, it tells me if I introduce any errors, as I introduce them, and tells me what they are, as Hugo uses live reload, everything is instant, so you know as soon as you make any change if there is an issue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Terminal 2 runs my diffing tool (currently &lt;code&gt;diffuse&lt;/code&gt;) as in, from within the root directory of my source, I just [up-arrow] -&amp;gt; [Enter] (which gives me &lt;code&gt;diffuse -m&lt;/code&gt;) any time I want to check my changes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Terminal 3 Stays on my master branch. This is where I &lt;code&gt;git status&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;git commit&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;git push&lt;/code&gt; from, etc. What happens in master in no way affects what is being pushed to gh-pages (live) though. &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; generates the static site from what ever is in the working directory, see next terminal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All that happens in the forth terminal, is I run &lt;code&gt;../&lt;/code&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/binarymist/BinaryMistBlog/blob/master/publish-to-gh-pages.sh&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;publish-to-gh-pages.sh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the sites root directory, which makes the site live. That&amp;rsquo;s right, one script to make your site live&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this is frictionless blogging 😆&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in getting a similar site set-up and are struggling, &lt;a href=&#34;https://binarymist.io/#contact&#34;&gt;let me know&lt;/a&gt; and I&amp;rsquo;ll be happy to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&#34;https://binarymist.io/blog/2018/02/24/hugo-with-staticman-commenting-and-subscriptions&#34;&gt;next post&lt;/a&gt; we will discuss how commenting and blog subscription was set-up&amp;hellip; Introducing dynamic behaviour to a static website&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

This is the second show Kim has hosted that&amp;rsquo;s made it into this list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;show-outline&#34;&gt;Show Outline&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;basic-questions&#34;&gt;Basic Questions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When moving to the Cloud, our servers/compute, storage, and many other physical aspects have now become abstract concepts. As a Software Engineer, what thoughts do you have on how we need to change our approach to security when moving to the cloud?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you explain what the &lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap05.html#leanpub-auto-shared-responsibility-model&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Shared Responsibility Model&lt;/a&gt; is, how it is supposed to work, and what sort of misconceptions are around it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In terms of the Shared Responsibility model, what aspects of security is the CSP (Cloud Service Provider) &lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap05.html#leanpub-auto-csp-responsibility-1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;responsible for&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;br /&gt;
(CSP takes care of infrastructure, not customer specific config of it)&lt;br /&gt;
(Due to scale of large CSPs, they should have good security resources)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In terms of the Shared Responsibility model, what is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap05.html#cloud-countermeasures-shared-responsibility-model-csp-customer-responsibility&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;customer responsible for&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;br /&gt;
(Their people -&amp;gt; AppSec -&amp;gt; configuring their infrastructure, using CSPs security features, concrete example of which security features we can use?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do you see as our highest risks in handing everything over to CSPs?
(fully understanding the Shared Responsibility Mode, people security (ignorance), application security (&lt;a href=&#34;https://binarymist.io/publication/ser-podcast-application-security/&#34;&gt;appsec with Zane Lackey #309&lt;/a&gt;), misconfiguration)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;assets-https-f1-holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers-com-chap05-html-leanpub-auto-ssm-asset-identification-1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap05.html#leanpub-auto-ssm-asset-identification-1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Assets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has what we are trying to protect as Software Engineers and the organisations we work for changed much from the exodus of on-premise to The Cloud and how so?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we need to adjust our thinking so that our security focus is in the right areas, and how should our focus have changed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the benefits of cloud computing, what are our assets we need to consider when threat modelling The Cloud and the suitability of various providers?&lt;br /&gt;
(productivity, competitive advantage, control, customer data, reputation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;risks-https-f1-holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers-com-chap05-html-cloud-identify-risks-countermeasures-https-f1-holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers-com-chap05-html-leanpub-auto-ssm-countermeasures&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap05.html#cloud-identify-risks&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Risks&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap05.html#leanpub-auto-ssm-countermeasures&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Countermeasures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I often receive questions from Software Engineers like “&lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap05.html#cloud-countermeasures-shared-responsibility-model-csp-customer-responsibility&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;As a software engineer, do I really care about network security&lt;/a&gt;”. Network security used to be slightly less of an issue for Software Engineers than it is now, network security used to be primarily the Network Administrator&amp;rsquo;s responsibility. Now that our infrastructure and networks are expressed by code, with infrastructure and configuration management tools such as: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/binarymist/aws-docker-host&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Terraform&lt;/a&gt; (which we’ve had a show on #289 with James Turnbull)), Ansible, Docker and others. What are your thoughts around the responsibility of &lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap04.html#network&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;network security&lt;/a&gt; now falling in the laps of Software Engineers?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I work a lot with AWS, which provides a security abstraction model. We can create objects like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VPC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security groups and roles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ingress and egress rules&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access control lists (ACLs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security roles attached to instances&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roles consisting of a set of profiles, etc
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we have another abstraction layer with tools such as terraform, which allow us to build these resources declaratively, rather than imperatively. This allows us to conceptualize and build what we want without understanding low level constructs such as firewalls (iptables), how to configure Cisco appliances, etc, and where to put these in our network topology. This dumbs down the skill set Software Engineers need. It also allows programmers to become network engineers in a sense. Do you see this as a step forward, or a step backward, or both?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As customers of The Cloud, we have little visibility of the internal workings or implementations of the infrastructural abstractions provided to us. Trust is a core concept that we are yielding to our providers. All software has bugs, How can we be sure that our chosen CSP is fixing their bugs quickly and not exposing us to undue risk?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is catastrophic data loss more of an issue in the cloud than it was on-prem due to CSP customers just believing the CSP will take care of it and occasionally failing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;evaluating-csps-https-f1-holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers-com-chap05-html-cloud-identify-risks-csp-evaluation&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap05.html#cloud-identify-risks-csp-evaluation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Evaluating CSPs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to talk a bit about how we can evaluate if using any given CSP is going to provide a high enough level of security for us and our customers&amp;hellip;
We’re going to discuss techniques we can use to compare different CSPs offerings, and whether or not they’re fit for our purpose. Feel free to mention any you can think of as we work through the &lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap05.html#cloud-countermeasures-csp-evaluation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;following list&lt;/a&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are your thoughts on keeping signed audit logs on UIs and APIs&lt;br /&gt;
(AWS has CloudTrail)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many CSPs are &lt;a href=&#34;https://binarymist.io/publication/ser-podcast-end-to-end-encryption/&#34;&gt;encrypting all comms&lt;/a&gt; between servers and CSP components within their data centres and also their service providers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap05.html#cloud-countermeasures-csp-evaluation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;What can we do&lt;/a&gt; to improve this situation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are CSPs providing customers access to infrastructural logs, what does that access look like, and how much is filtered before we get our hands on them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What happens with our data when we terminate our accounts with our provider or migrate to other providers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do we know where our services and data physically reside, In many cases CSPs are outsourcing their outsourced services to several providers deep. They do not even have visibility themselves. Often the data is hosted in other jurisdictions. What can we do about this? More crypto, then it doesn’t matter?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do we know who can view the data we store in the cloud (CSP employees), What checks and controls do the major CSPs have in place to make sure that this data can not be read or &lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap04.html#network-identify-risks-data-exfiltration-infiltration&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;exfiltrated&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many CSPs allow customers to carry out regular &lt;a href=&#34;https://f0.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap06.html#process-and-practises-penetration-testing&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;penetration testing&lt;/a&gt; of production and/or test environments?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are your thoughts on whether CSPs should run bug bounty programs?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are any CSPs standing out that you think are doing a decent job of their responsibilities, and helping potential customers understand where the lines of separation are in terms of the Shared Responsibility Model?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;csp-vs-in-house-https-f1-holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers-com-chap05-html-cloud-identify-risks-cloud-service-provider-vs-in-house&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap05.html#cloud-identify-risks-cloud-service-provider-vs-in-house&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CSP vs In-house&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are some of the aspects that are more secure in The Cloud than In-House?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;CSPs are tasked with taking care of aspects such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hardware&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hosting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuously hardening components and infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patching components only visible to the CSP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network firewall routes and rules of the CSPs core infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap04.html#network-countermeasures-lack-of-visibility-insufficient-logging&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Network component logging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap04.html#network-countermeasures-lack-of-visibility-nids&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;NIDS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regular penetration testing
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do those organisations contemplating In-house Cloud solutions need to consider all of these aspects?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any thoughts on how we can raise awareness on how the security dynamics change from self-hosting to all in “the Cloud”? What else do people need to think about, evaluate?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can we be better prepared for CSPs being &lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap05.html#leanpub-auto-giving-up-secrets&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;forced to give up&lt;/a&gt; our and our customers data to governing authorities and others without our permission or even knowledge in many cases? Does this just come down to using more crypto? What else can we do?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the topic of crypto, where do you see the government crusade against end-to-end encryption leading?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are your thoughts, as in costs and benefits around vendor lock-in in regards to leveraging the proprietary services and offerings of individual CSPs?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;other-risks&#34;&gt;Other Risks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSPs provide many security enhancing services and features, most of which I see Software Developers and people above them in the org chart think of as inconveniences. How can we encourage Developers and others to use the security features? More security by default? Other ideas?&lt;br /&gt;
(culprits: &lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap05.html#leanpub-auto-machine-instance-single-user-root&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;single user root&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap05.html#cloud-countermeasures-violations-of-least-privilege&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;least privilege violations&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap05.html#cloud-countermeasures-storage-of-secrets&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;storage of secrets&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap05.html#leanpub-auto-private-key-abuse-1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;private key abuse&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap05.html#cloud-countermeasures-storage-of-secrets-credentials-and-other-secrets&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;credential sharing&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any thoughts or security concerns around &lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap05.html#cloud-countermeasures-serverless&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Serverless technologies&lt;/a&gt; that “look” new, or that as Software Engineers we need to be thinking about?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;countermeasures-take-aways&#34;&gt;Countermeasures - Take Aways&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You created &lt;a href=&#34;http://flaws.cloud/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;FLAWS.cloud&lt;/a&gt; as a free online CTF/tutorial to help recognise common misconfigurations and gotchas in AWS. Can you talk a little bit about this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You were on the Purple Squad Security podcast recently discussing “Detecting Intruders on AWS”. Can you give us a bit of a rundown on what was discussed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You also wrote an article recently on “Potential Gaps in Suggested Amazon Web Services’ Security Policies for MFA” What goodness do you have to share with our listeners from this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I know of and documented &lt;a href=&#34;https://f1.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/chap05.html#cloud-countermeasures-aws-additional-tooling&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Security Monkey&lt;/a&gt; in the cloud chapter of my second book, for the listeners, can you talk a bit about this and also Airbnb’s StreamAlert?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can Software Engineers help to educate the C levels of the perils often not realised with the exodus to The Cloud, along with the considerations and countermeasures to establish a somewhat secure working environment, other than listening to today&amp;rsquo;s show?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there was only one piece of advice you could offer our Software Engineers today to help lift the security bar within their personal lives and the organisations they work within, what would it be?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
