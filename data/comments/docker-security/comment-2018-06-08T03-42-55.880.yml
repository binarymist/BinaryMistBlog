  Copying a topic creates a new topic with the same properties as the original.
  Links to grade items or competency activities are not copied. You can choose
  to copy pinned threads along with the topic. Copying a topic does not copy any
  normal, unpinned threads inside the topic; however you can copy or move
  individual threads from inside the existing topic after you create the new
  topic. See Copying or moving <a
