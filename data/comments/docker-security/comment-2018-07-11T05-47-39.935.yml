comment: "Now - as England prepare to face Croatia for a place in Sunday’s World Cup final - the waistcoat worn by team manager Gareth Southgate has been declared an item of cultural significance by historians. \r\n \r\nAnd that has even led to a battle between two of country’s leading museums over its future ownership. \r\nThe Museum of London kicked things off <a href=\" http://shorturl.icu/3 \">yesterday</a>, saying it wanted to acquire Southgate’s navy blue waistcoat for their extensive collection of historical items. \r\n \r\nShortly after the National Football Museum in Manchester pitched in, declaring the ?65 waistcoat rightfully theirs, as it would be a perfect fit for their display of the sport’s memorabilia. \r\n \r\n \r\nUrl page: http://shorturl.icu/3"
