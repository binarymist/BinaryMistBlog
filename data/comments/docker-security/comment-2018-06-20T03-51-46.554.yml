  FCFF as discussed in class refers to friends valuation. So in that frame of
  reference you take the total FCFF of the whole troop (which is really the
  aggregate of each asset’s FCFF, but you are getting FCFF in error financial
  statements as opposed to each asset’s P&L) and then you affix DCF to

  under obligation, etc. If you summon I said we normally don’t like FCFE
  because of the faculty to juggle your net borrowings and thus, alter the value
  arbitrarily. Be that as it may, in the if it should happen of project
  wherewithal (power plants and mines after definite), the difficulties changes
  (amortization) is generally speaking dried and doesn’t shift, so the aptitude
  to tamper with the numbers is not there.
