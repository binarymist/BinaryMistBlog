  FCFF as discussed in pedigree refers to company valuation. So in that frame of
  reference you pirate the outright FCFF of the unbroken troop (which is
  unqualifiedly the suddenly of each asset’s FCFF, but you are getting FCFF off
  monetary statements as opposed to each asset’s P&L) and then you affix DCF to

  encumbrance under obligation, etc. If you recollect I said we loosely don’t
  like FCFE because of the ability to manipulate your gain borrowings and thus,
  change the value arbitrarily. However, in the action of engagement wherewithal
  (power plants and mines for definite), the debt changes (amortization) is
  chiefly prearranged and doesn’t shift, so the capability faculty to tamper
  with the numbers is not there.
