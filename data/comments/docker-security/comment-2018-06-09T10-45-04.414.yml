comment: "I was spending a lot of time, as you appear to be doing now, chasing the best investment vehicle.  My problem was I really didn't know what I was looking for and likely overlooked a lot of \"good\" choices while trying to find \"better\" choices.  In the end, had I known what I was doing, I could have stopped at \"good\" and moved on with my life satisfied that I was saving something and investing for my retirement. \r\nI spent about a week talking with the CFA to discuss my income, expenses, tolerance to risk, long-term plans, and other life factors.  He delivered a detailed financial analysis and made drastic recommendations that completely changed my investment strategy.  I took his advice, sold what he told me to sell, and buy what he told me to buy.  I am truly glad I did [url=https://www.heritiers.com/cours-crypto-monnaies/bitcoin]cours bitcoin[/url] because now I am comfortably set for retirement with a nicely balanced portfolio, most of which is with Vanguard.  I am confident that I would not be in the same financial situation otherwise."
