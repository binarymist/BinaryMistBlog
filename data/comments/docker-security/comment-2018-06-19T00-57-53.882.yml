  require some problems with the currency switcher plugin. Nearby come up short,
  USD is in use. I’ve added some products with a toll of ‘100’, the
  [url=https://coursdubitcoin.tumblr.com/]quel est le cours du bitcoin[/url]
  store page showed ‘$100’. Then I changed the currency to EUR. The single
  impression: The output spot now shows the fit USD price ($106,83) but it
  should conduct the EUR expenditure (€100).
