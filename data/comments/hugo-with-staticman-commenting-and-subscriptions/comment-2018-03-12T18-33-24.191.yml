comment: "I think staticman informs mailgun of the merge, then you get the notification. Then I need to:\r\n1. pull\r\n2. perform any merges\r\n3. generate the new site locally\r\n4. run the [script] (https://github.com/binarymist/BinaryMistBlog/blob/master/publish-to-gh-pages.sh)\r\n5. Purge the cloudflare cache, which can take about 30 to 45 seconds\r\n6. Refresh the browser cache\r\n\r\nIf you go looking for the new comment(s) before step 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 have been completed, and then you perform step 6, then you won't see new comments."
