comment: "OK, that's great to know, My main concern currently is how many notifications anyone gets when a comment is submitted. There are currently three people subscribed to this post, I seem to be getting three notifications when anyone of us submits a comment and I accept it. Sounds like you are getting two notifications for every accepted PR. This seems like a bug. I'll discuss with Staticman.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for this."
