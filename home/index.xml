      <description>Helping you create and mentor security aware, cross functional, self-managing teams, able to create solutions that resist, and actively defend against today&amp;rsquo;s security attacks, while increasing profit and reducing costs.

Whether you&amp;rsquo;re running a small or large project, we can work with you to move the information security focus from late in the development life-cycle to within the development team. Thus saving significant costs, while improving quality, productivity, and predictability of software releases.</description>

      <description>Kim delivers high quality information security talks and workshops at conferences and private events around the world.
      Most of Kims talks and workshops are focussed around demonstrating and demystifying how easy it is to break into software and networks, followed with how you can rectify the demonstrated vulnerabilities, and make this part of your development teams process, rather than finding and fixing the defects once in production.</description>
